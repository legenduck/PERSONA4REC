While I enjoyed my meal, I definitely wasn't blown away like I have been at the cozier family run Indian spots. \n\nFor starters I got the spinach chaat. Dare I say this was like a fried salad. Literally little baby spinach leaves in a very very light batter fried until crisp. It was topped with some sauces, a sweet chile sauce and a creamy sauce. I've never had anything like this, it was delicious albeit not very filling. \n\nFor my entree I got the spicy chicken and waffles. I was honestly pretty let down by this. Don't get me wrong, it was good. The waffles were made well, the chicken was juicy and crispy. But they really failed to deliver on the spice. There was a sriracha drizzle and that was it. I don't need my palate burned out, but if you say spicy I want some spice. Not even necessarily heat spice, Indian chefs are literally masters of balancing spices. Even if it just had some cumin or curry in the batter, that would have made this stand out. \n\nDessert was a flight of some little goodies. I did really enjoy these perfect little bites to end the meal. The first was a rice pudding with some pistachios, the second a little banana donut doused in a luxurious caramel and finally a thick chocolate mouse covered in coconut. \n\nOverall this was an enjoyable meal but not a \"run don't walk\" here kind of place.

Before I say anything, as a disclaimer I did come during restaurant week for dinner so the menu is quiet different from the regular menu.

For starters the gave us a plate of papad with dipping sauce and it was alright nothing too special. The shorba I think was a little bland, it lacked flavor and it was the 2nd course.

However, maybe because it was restaurant week, the restaurant was very loud and crammed. Below are the dishes we tried. The restaurant week menu allowed each of us to order an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert (which was the same for everyone) \n\nAppetizers:\n- Crispy Spinach Chaat: 4.5/5 - The flavor and texture were so great in this dish. It was just salty enough and the crispiness was perfect. The sauce drizzled on top was great and this dish is great to share. Definitely recommend!\n- Vegetable Samosa Chaat: 3.5/5 - A pretty standard samosa with a nice filling and crunchy wrapping. The chickpeas served with the chaat were great! \n- Crispy Cauliflower: 3.5/5 - This cauliflower sort of tasted like buffalo sauce. It was really creative but the breaded coating was too thick for me personally.  \n\nEntrees: \n- Chicken and Waffles: I can't give a rating for this one since I didn't try it but my roommates who ordered this dish really enjoyed it. They were extremely impressed with the dish and said it was very filling as well. \n- Chole Bhature: 4/5 - The bhatura was really delicious - fluffy and soft. I am a huge fan of chickpeas so I ordered this dish. It was pretty good but nothing super unique or creative. \n\nDessert:\n- Dessert Sampler Trio: 4/5 - The three desserts were a scoop of chocolate mousse, gulab jamun (fried dough ball soaked in syrup), and a rice pudding. I really liked all three! The chocolate mousse was rich and not to sweet while the gulab jamun was very fluffy and light on the inside. The rice pudding was also not too sweet.

My friend and I did the tasting menu where we got 2 starters, a tandori, 2 entrees and 2 desserts.  If it sounds like a lot of food its because it is:-)  But when the quality of the food is like this you honestly wish your stomach was 3x the size so you can enjoy every tasty morsel and then some.  \n\nFor starters, we shared the crispy spinach chaat and the bbq pork samosa rolls.  The Spinach chat was a prefect blend of spices and crunch, and served with it was a little bit of onions and tomatoes which gave me almost a hint of having \"chips and salsa\", but with the Indian twist.  The samosa rolls were also very good with a creamy sauce but I definitely thought the chaat stole the show.\n\nOur second course was the Noorani shrimp.  The shrimp was grilled to perfection and the tomato based sauce which reminded me very much of tikka masala sauce was a nice addition but I thought the dish did not need it.  The dish was also served with some lightly pickled onions and carrots which added a nice contrast and cuts through the sauce just enough so that the shrimp can be front and center.\n\nUp until now we are already having a great meal and thought things can not possibly top what we've had so far but boy were we glad we were wrong.  The Malai Kofta Bukhara and the Vindaloo were the perfect choices because the cashew cream sauce of the Kofta Bukhara was just the right choice of entree to balance the spice level of the Vindaloo, which was to be honest not that spicy.  However I loved it regardless because so often when you order Vindaloo, all you taste is the heat.  Not in this case, by making the dish a gentle medium I actually got to taste the tender pork which honestly I could not believe was pork.  In other words the preparation of this dish elevates all the ingredients to a level I have never experienced before.  \n\nIf all we had was these courses I would have given this place a 5 for sure but there was just one thing that I thought could have been handled a little differently.  Our desserts were too large!!:-)  and a little too boring.  Now I realize that this maybe a personal thing but half the size would have been perfect, and we had ice cream with deep fried fruit.  The ice cream was delicious but was too sweet and overpowered the fried banana balls and pear.  \n\nI would love to have given this place a 4.5 but I always round down so 4 it is.  But as far as I'm concerned, this is by far the best Indian place I've every been too, not only was the food excellent, the service, drinks, which i didn't even talk about, and ambiance were all on point.

We went for happy hour on a cold fall night, which was perfect. My sister is new to the area and had already enjoyed a wonderful HH visit, so she wanted to take me along for her second. Luckily, there were two spots on the far right of the bar waiting for us.\n\nWe ordered vegetable samosa chaat, shrimp koliwada soft tacos, chicken tikka chipotle, sali boti poutine, and stuffed gulab jamun. The samosas were standard but the best they could be. The shrimp tacos were ultra clever, with roti standing in for a tortilla, and they were tied with the poutine for my favorite dish of the night. The chicken tikka is the only thing we agreed we wouldn't order again, despite its deliciousness. We were expecting something saucier but got skewered, grilled chicken breast chunks.\n\nThe gulab jamun WAS NOT on the HH menu, but we were both hankering for something sweet after all of that spice. If I could describe IndeBlue's rendition in one word, it would be dreamy. Three donuts stuffed with mascarpone and rose petal marmalade, and topped with slivered almonds. Oh, man.

It was a bit rocky from the start as the host and a server exchanged some terse words before we were even seated. The busy host was trying to make sure tables were cleared and as he requested this to one of the servers he snapped his fingers a few times. As we stood there, the server confronted the host from across the room, \"Did you snap your fingers at me? We don't snap fingers!\" It was off putting and unprofessional. If there was cause for confrontation, it should have been done privately. \n\nAfter we were seated we settled in with the crispy spinach chaat and vegetable samosa chaat. They were both delicious. The crispy spinach chaat was the highlight of the meal. One of my daughters ordered the rassam which included cauliflower, baby carrots, french beans and coconut. It was pretty tasty but definitely on the smaller side. The vegetables were prepared well...still carried a crunch and the sauce was well flavored and creamy. My other daughter ordered the paneer tika masala and I ordered the madras with free range chicken breast. These, in my opinion, were average. They didn't blow me away but they tasted fine. I think I was expecting the chicken to be less dry tasting and it tasted how I usually experience chicken in Indian food take out. I am fine when it's your run of the mill take out...but was expecting more from this upscale place. One thing I did appreciate is that I asked for heat with my dish and it arrived bursting with it. Sometimes I find, even if I ask for spicy it comes lacking. This did not. \n\nI wanted to order wine with my dinner but once the food runner dropped off our food, we were not checked on until the end. By that time, I had ditched the idea of having wine. Our server was kind, but inattentive. We skipped dessert for the same reason.

Tried to go here for dinner tonight and was reminded at the last minute that it may be a good idea to call before just to alert them that Daisy would be accompanying us for dinner. The hostess picked up and said, \"we don't take service dogs.\" So I proceeded to say, \"well that's funny because it's illegal for you to deny us access\" (said in the kindest tone that I could manage given the situation). He then told me to hold on while he spoke to his manager and came back by saying, \"oh we do take service dogs,\" to which I said \"will you please cancel my reservation?\" Why would I want to support a restaurant that doesn't train their staff on the importance of legislation that supports PWD?! He proceeded to say, \"oh no are you sure? I love dogs. I would've loved to meet the dog. We just previously had a woman come in without the proper paperwork.\" But what paperwork?! As I've ranted about before, paperwork for service dogs is NOT a thing. I could buy a $50 ID card and letter from a doctor saying that I need a service dog on Amazon (totally FAKE and really impacts how people view service animals!!!!), but just to support some dubious organization?! Also, you can't ask for that anyways. You can only ask if the dog is a service dog and what service the dog provides. The ADA purposefully makes it as accessible as possible for PWD to get service dogs. Just because I don't have a visible disability doesn't mean that I need Daisy any less.

A restaurant could have the finest food in the city (and IndeBlue doesn't) but if diners are met with indifference and hostility, that is the impression that sticks in the mind.\n\nMy first visit here was 2 years ago for happy hour with my friend Stephen.   We were in the area and decided to try IndeBlue for drinks. We arrived a few minutes before 5 p.m. As we opened the door, a woman from inside the restaurant came and physically blocked us from coming in. We were both taken aback and asked if there was a problem. She demanded to know what we were doing \"there.\" Let me take a second to say that we are both gay and we are also clean, fit and when we are out and about, always well dressed. This time was no exception to any of that. Instead of  just walking away, Stephen told her we had come for happy hour. Her posture relaxed a bit but she said it did not start until 5 p.m. (by now it was 4:56 p.m.) and we would have to wait outside until then. Given that we saw other drinkers and diners in the restaurant, this made no sense. I told my companion that this was all bullshit but he said we had a right to drink and eat anywhere so eff it, let's do it. \n\nThe drinks and bar food were fine, nothing innovative or memorable and the bartender, a woman, was very pleasant and accommodating, especially when we asked for drink recommendations. We spent several hours eating and drinking at the bar and had no further issues. \n\nA few months ago, several friends decided to have a 'catch up' brunch here on a Saturday. Reservations were made and we all arrived on time. As soon as we were ready to be seated, we all became aware of tension and hostility emanating from the host and the wait staff. Whether it was directed at us (a group of 10) or it was internal, I cannot say, but it made the hair on my neck stand up. We were shown to a table that did not have enough seats or space for all of us. Mervyn, the brunch organizer, politely asked if a larger table was available. We were left to stand by a table that sat 6. When a member of our party took 2 chairs from unoccupied tables so we could start to get seated, one of the servers started to loudly berate him. Again, as far as I was concerned, that was a cue to leave. Finally we were placed at a table with barely enough room for all 10 of us. And then we sat. And sat.  And sat. \n\nKeep in mind that a reservation had been made weeks in advance for 10 diners. We did not just show up out of the blue in a large group on a busy Saturday. \n\nWhen our orders were taken, the server was very curt and would not answer questions about the menu. We placed our orders and got on with socializing. When the food came, it was slammed down on the table and our drinks, also slammed down, got sloshed all over. The food was fine but lukewarm. I'd ordered a masala dosa, basically an Indian potato crepe. The crepe itself was warm, limp and greasy, not piping hot and crisp. My Bloody Mary was too heavily spiced to enjoy. No one came by to check on us or see if we wanted more drinks. We all passed on ordering dessert. We just wanted to get out. \n\nNo one greatly disliked their food but no one felt it was outstanding or even good, either. Several gents ordered the tasting menu and getting the server to provide details about it had been absolutely impossible.  \n\nI don't want to say this place is homophobic but I do believe there are a lot of unresolved issues between staff and management that spill over into treatment of guests. That is totally unacceptable.\n\nIn each case, I should have just gotten up and left.

The bed of chickpeas, yogurt, and chutney matched the flavors of the Samosa's perfectly. Hate to say it but I overheard the table next to us say that the soup was very good so we ordered that. An  asparagus soup with basil chutney. It was the perfect combination of spice and asparagus flavor. My wife ordered that Laal Maas which she said was great. I ordered the Dal Thali which is an array of vegetable dishes with rice and Naan. Speaking of Naan the garlic Naan is awesome. But back to my dish. The black dairy (lentils in a dark curry), yellow tadka (lentils in a yellow curry) and the chana masala (chickpeas in spices) were all fantastic.

My friend ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala with a side of butter Naan, and I ordered a Chicken Makhani with garlic naan. The samosas were perfectly crisp with ample vegetable filling, and the savory samosas paired well with the tart sweetness in the tamarind sauce from the chick peas. However, I am more used to the traditional rustic-style and deconstructed Samosa chaat. As for our dishes, we sampled each other's entrees, and the sauce for the Tikka Masala and the Makhani were extremely similar. As a person who is not a fan of spicy food, I was actually missing the spice in these dishes. The sauces were reminiscent of a tomato bisque, which isn't a bad thing, but we were missing those beautiful aromas of cumin, chili powder and turmeric that make these dishes so beautiful. I understand that Tikka Masala and Makhani are more of the \"gateway\" dishes to traditional Indian cuisine, but the flavors were just not there. On the up side, the chicken and the paneer were tender and flavorful, and the naan was warm, crisp and chewy. For dessert, we split a Banana Nirvana, which consisted of three banana gulab jamun topped with a salted caramel ice cream. The banana gulab jamun were warm, doughy, and not too sweet, but the salted caramel ice cream was too sugary for my liking. \n\nOverall, I would definitely categorize this restaurant as more \"Indian fusion\" that would cater to a palate that perhaps isn't used to bold flavors, or a palate that would need to be slowly introduced to Indian food.

I thought that the scallop would get lost with the intense flavor of the sauce but the scallop held it's own giving the dish a nice seafood flavor.\n\nFor the entrees we got the chicken korma and afghani lamb shank.  The chicken korma was delicious and we sopped up all that delicious sauce with the naan that came with the entrees.  The chicken breast was also very moist.  I normally prefer dark meat, but the chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry.  The lamb shank practically fell off the bone when tapped with a fork and there was very little fat.  This dish was the star of the night for me as it was tender, nicely seasoned, and the rice with raisins gave a nice sweet contrast to the tender meat.\n\nFor dessert we got the deconstructed apple pie and chocolate pot de creme.  Both pretty standard but delicious nonetheless. \n\nThe only negative about the experience was they forgot to pack my wife's chicken korma leftovers.  Due to being a bariatric patient, she cannot finish full portions and tends to enjoy leftovers as a second or even third meal.  It's a shame to waste perfectly delicious food.

The Indebluetini drink was delicious, a balance of sweet and savory. Skip the chai sangria. We ordered the crispy spinach chaat, chicken makhani poutine, crispy cauliflower and drums of heaven. My favorites were the chaat and poutine. The spinach chaat looked disappointing as it was served because it looked like boring baked crisp spinach. When I took a bite of it, all I could think of was omg. How was this so good?? The sauce and everything about it was delicious and extremely flavorful. \nI was excited about the chicken poutine because of my poutine experiences in Canada. This dish had only a couple cheese curds and melted cheddar cheese. But I enjoyed this dish nonetheless. The fries were crispy, cheese perfectly melted and everything complimented each other.\nThe crispy cauliflower and drums of heaven had similar flavor profiles and were pretty hearty dishes. The drums of heaven were decent sizes of chicken wings. The crispy cauliflower was good but not that crispy. I liked the sauces that came with it but I understand why other reviewers compare it to marinara sauce. \n\nWe then got the tandoori chicken tikka chipotle and garlic naan (lasooni). I thought these dishes were okay. The naan could've been taken to the next level if it had some salt. The tandoori chicken was tender but I wish it had more spices and flavor.

It was super easy to order online and pickup was also a breeze. The food did cool by the time we got home (~40 min) so we reheated everything in the oven.\n\nCrispy Spinach Chaat: For my takeout buddies, the light brown sauce goes with the spinach!! I didn't realize this and thought the disk was \"just okay\" until I realized I had been missing the sauce the entire time. After I put in on, the dish got so much better, the sweetness of the sauce perfectly complemented the crunchiness of the spinach and shallots. People rave about this dish, and I understand why. \n\nDrums of Heaven: This dish was solid. Do note that you don't get that many pieces total (I think around 4 or 5?). However, I think if I were to order again, I would skip on this dish and get something more unique.\n\nCrispy Cauliflower: My personal favorite! You feel like you're eating popcorn chicken and the softness of the cauliflower pairs perfectly with the crunchiness of the shell and spicy dipping sauce.\n\nShrimp Moilee & Rice: Really enjoyed this dish, it was perfectly creamy and spiced and we had a couple good-sized pieces of shrimp. The rice was also nice and fragrant, I would just warn you not to make the mistake I did and ingest an entire chili and then have to chug a glass of milk.\n\nChicken Poutine: Okay I was very excited to eat this but it kinda fell flat for me. However, I think this was more of a result of our reheating process than the food itself, so if you are ordering in person, it will probably taste better. We weren't really able to get the cheese to melt on the fries right, the chicken felt a little dry, and the cheese curds felt kinda removed from the rest of the dish.\n\nAcross all the dishes, I feel like the spicy profile was just right.

The staff here is so friendly and so helpful too! \nWe got drinks and a bunch of food to share!\n\nI got the Born Feral drink - description states a milk punch but it's not milky.. the cocktail is clear and a little brown. It tasted a little tart with a hint of smokiness/bacon? It was surprisingly good and I loved how tart it was\n\nFor food we ordered the spicy carrot hummus, scallop crudo, PEI mussels, and the oysters (orleans cocktail)\n\nSpicy Carrot Hummus - the texture isn't as smooth as a regular hummus but it's good and spicy! And you can taste a hint of the carrot (the taste is not too strong). This is served with a side of toasted bread\n\nScallop Crudo - this is the tastiest scallop crudo I have ever had in my life. Not only is it beautiful to look at, adorned with flowers and peach, and toasted sweet cashew, but it was super creamy and fresh! It kind of melts in your mouth with a creamy texture and pairs really well with the lime aioli and the toasted crushed cashew it comes with . (This was my favorite dish)\n\nPEI mussels - this is my second favorite dish. The mussels are of good size and cooked really well! The sauce that comes with the mussels is excellent, you will want to drench your toasted bread in there. There is a chunk of sausage meat that is in the dish and that is seasoned very well and a perfect texture too. I would definitely recommend this for any mussel\n lover\n\nOrleans Cocktail (oysters) - this is a pretty version of oysters. It's oysters on a bed of salt, garnished with lavender and peaches. It's pretty but the oysters are a little too salty for my taste. Again, it's pretty but if you're going for fresh oysters, I would skip this.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent place for dinner.

We had gone a few times in the early stages of their opening, and were in awe of the atmosphere and decor inside, but it's only during these crazy times that Bloomsday finally won us over. \n\nWith the pandemic stripping away the glitz and glamour of the interior, the focus had to shift strictly to service and menu, and for us, they've done a great job. Their staff has been wonderful, outgoing, and always willing to help us pick wines from their unique, carefully-curated wine list that's loaded with natural wines (many from Catalonia, which is fun to see!). It's gotten to the point where we just ask them to choose for us, and Tim has never steered us wrong! Nor has he repeated a wine, with their selection constantly rotating as they're able to procure new options.\n\nThe current food menu is pretty limited, but that's hardly a complaint, and everything has been delicious! The fish & chips on Fridays are some of the best we've had, with a really nice, crispy exterior and a perfectly-cooked fish that offers up all the flavor and zero dryness. Their burgers are great, and the 3-ounce \"Rich Burger\" is a steal at $6 (or $5 at happy hour). You don't see patatas bravas often in Philly, but as people who run around Spain-or did so until recently-trying to eat as many different bravas preps as we can, we can say that Bloomsday is doing a great job with their version! Just the right amount of aioli, with more of a focus on the potatoes and their mild bravas sauce. We've had salads, brunch, pastries, dessert, and coffee (they use Rival Bros.), and everything has been executed wonderfully. At first glance, the limited menu may not seem that impressive, but there are legit crave-worthy items that keep us coming back. This limited menu seems to have allowed their staff to focus on executing well with consistently, which is sort of what we crave in this crazy, inconsistent world right now.\n\nOverall, Bloomsday has become one of our favorite places in the city. The food is delicious, affordable, consistent, and approachable, with just enough twists to keep things a little exciting. The service has been exceptional, as well. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and passionate about what they're doing...and it's shows. If you like natural wines, you'd be crazy not to check this spot out. \n\nAs a bonus, the restaurants on the street have been allowed to set up seating under the shambles, so while you can't enjoy the beautiful interior of Bloomsday, there's little drop-off in atmosphere, and you're still under cover on those rainy summer evenings. Honestly, these days, there are few places we'd rather be than sitting outside under the shambles, sipping on some vermouth and snacking on bravas, while talking natural wines with their staff. Thankfully, Bloomsday provides the option to do so, and I only hope that whenever things return to some semblance of normal, that they don't lose the charm that keeps bringing us back!

The food is superb. There's an excellent selection of food and everything is well executed. The drinks are awesome too. I dined there on Sunday and the meal was as yummy as expected. \n\nThe customer service was not yummy. At some time after 1:20PM, after we'd finished eating, after we'd finished our Satchmo cocktails, 10 Cane mojitos and Hennessy sangrias and importantly....after we'd settled the bill, a manager came over to inform of that there is a two hour limit on the buffet and we've been there since 11AM (opentable reservation) and our table is needed. -_- Whet???? You have to appreciate that we were one of 3 occupied tables (two other parties of two) in the front dining area that seats 60ppl at least. The place was empty. \"We need the table\" was a lame excuse that I'll explain more in a sec. The issue was that this manager seemed to think that we were two people who would sit around and eat all day and she needed to call time on our eating. But we weren't eating. We were at the table talking and catching up. Bill paid. Plates cleared. Our server had no issue with our presence at all. After the offense washed over me I realized 1) I'm not eating but I also wasn't informed at the time of seating of this two hour dining policy 2) surely this exchange could have been handled with more tact 3) why do I feel shamed for sitting at a table in an empty dining area catching up with a friend on a Sunday? \n\nMy friend felt compelled to gather our things and talk to the manager on the way out. I was more inclined to ignore nonsense until it makes sense meaning continue as we were. I lost. On the way out we talked the MOD who genuinely apologetically explained that it's a restaurant wide policy they are required to enforce because \"people come in like it's an old country buffet.\" I wanted to retort that her management approach mirrors that in that it wasn't patron friendly or reflective of customer service practices but alas... I'm disheartened that Relish thinks of themselves on par with fast casual venues. I've liken them to my local high end dining destination. In turn I've expected much more tactful and customer friendly service. If I wanted to be timed on my seating and invited to leave brunch, there are several other places I could be treated poorly for less. I truly expected more respect and value for the guest experience. I have had better experiences there. I believe they are capable of better. \n\nBack to the \"we need the table\" position. After talking with the manager, my friend and I continued our conversation for another hour in the waiting area. During that time zero people were seated at our table or in the front dining area. Our waitress continued to serve the couples in the area which suggests that we weren't holding up closing the area. The manager even walked by and said, \"oh you guys are still here?\" Funny that would have been a perfect opportunity to redeem the situation by inviting us in to a heated area but nope. I really considered the options for what happened here and I continue to land on daft, unskilled management and communication. It wasn't the chefs, the waitstaff or the hostesses.

Bad. Then I proceeded to the made to order omelet station. They were on top of their game here. I added red pepper, turkey sausage, mushroom and black pepper in my omelet cooked hard. It was made perfect. Right next to the omlet station are made to order waffles. On the well appointed buffet were green beans, collards, cabbage, shrimp etouffee, turkey sausage, southern fried chicken, clams in garlic, ceasar and pasta salad, assorted sweets and my favorite, Challah bread French toast. I was saddened by the fact they only had the ubiquitous Mrs. Buttersworth syrup which I hate. So I ate the French toast naked. It was amazing.  I don't think I have ever had French toast without syrup but this one time was amazing. Soft, sweet, moist. Yes, I could be describing that too, but I'm talking about the Frenchm toast here--focus! So I had an omelet, French toast, collards, turkey bacon and curry sausage for round one. Round two I had a fried chicken leg, cabbage and an incredible brownie. All were very good.

I was HANGRY by the time we got our food.\n\nWhen we arrived home, the food was lukewarm so we had to reheat it BUT everything tasted amazing!

Both platters were also served with appetizer samplers and dessert samplers - yum, yum, yum... The appetizer platter contained a Caesar salad topped with lump crab meat (no shell residue), 2 halves of jerk chicken rolls, 2 scallops wrapped in bacon and a deviled egg topped with shrimp... Again, deeeelicious!!! In addition to this, there was also a black eyed pea stew added as well as a side of cornbread. All accompaniments were just what I needed (but didn't know - lol). I could not finish my food in one sitting because it was so much but I will be eating my leftovers - lol.\n\nI would highly recommend getting take out from Relish or dining in (when possible); the food is great and prepared to perfection and the prices aren't bad. I've dined here a few times pre-COVID with small groups and the ambiance of the restaurant is lively and the music is on point along with the food.\n\nFinal note to management - please prepare better in the future.

The menu for their special tasting was as follows...\n-Yellow Corn Bisque with peekytoe crab croquette\n-Crab Agnolotti with our chorizo and basil\n-Crispy Soft Shell Crab with summer squash and green goddess \n-Goats Milk Biscuit with sour cherry preserves and clotted cream  \n\nThe soup was sublime. I would order it for my last meal. The crab croquette was a delicious combo of a lightly crispy puff of air, filled with a delicious delicate  crab meat. Everything was as good as it sounds. The soft shell crab was out of this world. This was the best softshell crab experience I've ever had, by far. The experience was Light, airy, crispy, crunchy and creamy and ridiculously good. \n    I am not a big fan of biscuits for dessert. I could be the only person on the planet that does not love a strawberry shortcake.  Therefore the Goat's Milk Biscuit was not my cup of tea. Maybe I actually needed a cup of tea, but it was more like a crumbling scone to me. Not to worry! The Sour Cherry preserves and clotted cream were nice to nibble on after a perfect meal, and obviously, the rest of the meal made up for this particular dessert. \n    Of course, now I'm dying to go back to Mica to try more! I can't wait to experience  their mid week prefix tasting menu again and also Sample some their \"standards\" on the main menu.   (they also offer a tasting menu along with à la cart and Don't forget to bring your nice wine it's BYOB)", "extracted_aspects": {"cuisine_category": "Seafood", "cuisine_category_reason": "The diner expresses enthusiasm for a seafood-focused tasting menu, indicating a preference for seafood cuisine.", "specific_dishes_or_attributes": "The Yellow Corn Bisque was sublime, and I would order it for my last meal.", "visit_purpose": "To try Mica restaurant after being a long-time fan of Black Fish.", "visit_purpose_reason": "The diner has been wanting to try Mica for many years, motivated by their admiration for its sister restaurant, Black Fish.", "quality_criteria": "The soft shell crab was out of this world, but the Goat's Milk Biscuit was not my cup of tea.", "visit_context": "The diner visited Mica restaurant on a Tuesday night.", "visit_context_reason": "The diner visited on a Tuesday night when the restaurant was pretty full due to a pending holiday."}}, {"review_id": "H9leVX4Xmvb6K2BOD9o6zw", "item_id": "3Rj9ItAP5k_i6YVmFJgC9w", "user_id": "p951eClfn_bx4Is3IB6tpg", "rating": 5.0, "timestamp": "2019-10-12 14:27:33", "review_text": "Everything was tasty.

I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience mostly because I do not come into Chestnut Hill often and had never heard of Mica before. Although I am usually the researcher, my husband actually found out about Mica and booked the reservation and we had an exceptional time this past weekend.\n\nThe restaurant looks to be a converted row home and we had the pleasure of sitting in their cozy front room with big windows looking out the front and a charming fireplace. Our server, Sean, was very attentive throughout the meal and also very knowledgeable. When we had questions, we could tell Sean was answering honestly and steered us in the right direction when making our choices.\n\nWe started with their complimentary bread and onion croquette which were both well done. For appetizers, my husband and I shared the maryland crab beignets, the tuna tartare and the foie gras. For us, tuna tartare/crudo/anything raw tuna and foie gras are our go-to, must-try starters and we were beyond impressed with Mica's interpretations. The foie gras was wrapped in swiss chard which I have never seen before but lent itself beautifully to the perfectly salty foie gras. The tuna was incredibly fresh and I even commented that it was the best tuna I've had since our trip to Hawaii in 2018 where I had the most amazing fish. The crab beignets were not to be overlooked and were plump little mounds of flaky dough filled with sweet crab. We had also wanted to try the savory doughnuts with raclette but Sean, rightfully, suggested those + the beignets would be too rich so I am making plans to come back to try the doughnuts another time!\n\nFor our entrees, I had the hanger steak with brussels sprouts while my husband had the swordfish and we shared the saffron rice with crispy shirmp. My entrees was presented beautifully, was cooked to perfection, and the flavors were complementary. My husband's dish, in my opinion, was better than mine; the swordfish was flaky and moist and was accompanied by both mussels and clams! I tried a bite of everything and it was delicious!! The rice was a great side dish for my husband's meal and was also divine- the crispy shrimp added the perfect little crunch. \n\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and I love a BYOB with great food as it's the only way to convince my husband to drink champagne with me!

I went there for a friends dinner last Saturday it was a group of about 12 of us. Despite the reviews I read on Yelp, I still decided to give Jordan Johnson's a try..very bad decision.

Then when we tried to correct her we were told \" oh I didn't get that you ordered that\" as if we lied about out orders. Appetizers took easily an hour to come out. Everyone got their appetizer except me I had to remind the waitress about 2 times that I ordered Honey Buffalo wings..I was brought Thai Chili wings. About 10 minutes after that I was finally brought the wings I ordered (not sure why the Honey Buffalo wings were black..)\n\nOn to the entrees which also took a long time. I was one of the last people to get my entree and again I had to remind the waitress that I ordered the salmon scampi. She seemed confused and she thought there were only 3 orders of salmon scampi. When I finally get my food..it definitely was not worth the wait. The salmon, mashed potatoes, and spinach were bland. It appeared to have a lot of seasoning on the plate yet it still tasted bland. Oh yea and I ordered broccoli but somehow ended up with spinach! Again we had to tell the waitress that I wanted a side of broccoli not spinach. I tried someone else from the party's broccoli and surprise, surprise it was terrible. About 15 minutes later they finally came with a side of broccoli..smh.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend Jordan Johnson's to a friend, family member, or foe.

I got 2 appetizers and an entrée.  The total came to $47 which seems a little high, but the shrimp were large and it was good.  \n\nThe only reason I need to give 3 stars instead of 5 is because they don't do any take out.   I walked in at 4:30pm and requested a take-out menu. The hostess said they don't have one.  And they don't take any phone orders.  I had to go sit at the bar and place the order to go. I thought that was incredibly bizarre and weird giving there was only 1 other person eating at the restaurant at the time.  So I placed my order and came back in 30 minutes.\n\nLuckily the food was delicious, I got the shrimp scampi appetizer, the sweet Thai chili shrimp and their signature shrimp curry with fried rice entrée ($5 upcharge for fried rice).\n\nThe sweet Thai chili shrimp was my favorite. It was the most balanced dish with both sweetness and spices. The second thing I loved was the shrimp curry.  Followed by the shrimp scampi. \n\nThe real letdown here is this business not accepting phone orders for takeout. I talked to the sweet lady at the bar and she simply says they cannot handle that because it gets busy, and I mentioned many other businesses get busy that are a lot larger than this and have no problem taking phone orders and doing takeout and it's simply a matter of having the right staff.  (obviously something they are lacking and it seems they refuse to remedy, shame)\n\nI also wish they would stop using these cheap styrofoam takeout containers.  Warning: If you get ANY curry shrimp, it will become a hot mess once you get home with it. With some curry coming out of the container or worse.   Luckily mine wasn't so bad.  Tip:  How about separating the shrimp curry from the fried rice? That way it doesn't come flying out of your cheap containers.\n\nOther than the take out issues the food is really good.

When Bourbon Blue does attempt to add its own flair, the results are often disastrous. For example, when I ordered their tator tot poutine, I was shocked by what I was served. The concept is great - tator tots, country gravy, cheese curds, and pulled pork. Unfortunately, the pulled pork was merely a pile of fatty pieces of pork. My best guess is that whoever plated my poutine unintentionally toped it with pork from the scrap bucket. It was truly disgusting.

The ambiance of Bourbon Blue is really lively. The lighting, the wood in the A-framed roof/ceiling and the way the bar is set up all makes for beautiful scenery.

Our server, Madison, was absolutely awesome, super helpful and down to earth. She helped us make our food and beer selections for the night. So out of this you might be asking why I've rated this place 3 stars. The 3 stars really has more to do with the food here. With a Cajun or Creole style menu, Bourbon Blue attempts to offer an upgraded pub experience with mildly elevated prices. What the menu lacked in classically delicious options like gumbo, crawfish, etouffee, etc. it attempted to make up in upgraded pub options like blackened chicken Caesar wrap, alligator sausage quesdilla and spicy shrimp and grits. My husband and I ordered calamari to share and jambalaya and blackened salmon for our individual meals. We were excited to learn that there was complimentary corn bread, however, were dissapointed to see 1 portion of cornbread was to be shared by 2 guests -- seems a bit stingy. Fortunately, Madison offered to bring us another once we finished that portion. The meals themselves were just okay. The jambalaya was a bit too soupy and while the salmon was cooked to perfection the green beans on the side were much too oily and the mashed potatoes were bland.

It's just a couple blocks from us and we kept walking by saying we had to try it some day but we never got around to it. Last night was THE night! I made a reservation for 2 at 7:30 on a Thursday. We probably didn't need it, but shortly after we got there the place did fill up.\n\nThe place... Is small. Borderline claustrophobic. The bar takes up half of the restaurant. If you want to try this place and also enjoy breathing then I recommend waiting until the weather is nice and you can sit outside. It was a tight squeeze and we are two tiny people. Did not like that the entire restaurant is basically one long bench with tables and chairs pulled up to it. I know a lot of restaurants are like that now but I really do enjoy having a more private table. I did use the bathroom before leaving and while it was freezing down there I do love me a restaurant with gender neutral bathrooms. There's never a line.\n\nThe server was great. I think his name was Evan. He was attentive and genuinely seemed to enjoy working there. Good for him!\n\nWe ordered some new and exciting beers. My boyfriend tried something from Korea and I tried something from Japan that was labeled a witbier on the menu. It wasn't what I am used to from American witbiers ... It had a funky aftertaste that I usually would expect from an IPA and I really hate IPAs. But it was a $12 bottled beer so I couldn't exactly have tried it before I bought it. Should have gone with the cider or the hot toddy! Boyfriend thought his beer was okay but ended up getting a Sapporo. \n\nWe started off with the soy kfc, which was perfectly crunchy yet moist and flavorful, and the short rib steamed buns. I expected more of a bao bun for some reason on the steamed buns and these were more like a dry biscuit so that was a little sad to me. Boyfriend ate the rest of my bun so I could save room for dinner. For our entrees I ordered from that night's special menu, the glass noodles, and boyfriend ordered a bowl of bibimbap. He liked his dish (can't go wrong with a hot bowl on a cold night!) but mine was unexpectedly spicy. It's entirely possible the menu warned me about the spice but we had a couple drinks before dinner and I may have just seen the word \"noodle\" and got excited and ordered without a proper read. I ordered it \"with seafood\" and it came with shrimp, calamari, and little baby squiddy jawns. It was flavorful and had some nice textures to it, but the spice got me. I ate about half of it and had to take the rest home.\n\nOverall, I was happy I tried something new and that itch was completely scratched for the evening, but I think if we came back we would pop over for happy hour (every day!) and stick to the appetizers menu. I would also switch up the drink and try a cocktail. I told a coworker about our dinner there and she said the appetizers are really where its at and we made a bad call getting entrees.

It's an entertaining and enjoyable Korean (American) experience which I can and will return to.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  There were some communication issues with the kitchen that kept this from being 5 stars, but nothing overly concerning.\n\nThe Good:\n\nI previously had the Bulgogi burger and recently had the Dolsot Bibambap at Southgate.  The burger was cooked appropriately, with a nice spice, but wasn't overly impressive.  The bun was a bit messy.  I was craving a burger, which is why I got something I wouldn't normally consider.  It was fine but nothing overly exciting.  \n\nThe Bibambap is definitely a star here.  Very saucy, a little less spicy than I'd hope, but flavorful and delicious.  The gooey egg was an enjoyable addition and the beef (optional), had the right spice to really enhance the meal.  I definitely would order again.  It was also incredibly filling.\n\nWe also tried the Cheesesteak buns, which were a little more crispy than I was used to, but delicious.  Perhaps a bit too bready, but we enjoyed quite a bit.  \n\nThe service was fast and attentive.  Our drinks, both water and cocktails, were frequently filled and re-ordered.  The place was busy and ideally staffed.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe dumplings were frankly pretty lame.  Unspecial and comparable to standard fare.  \n\nThere was some miscommunication between the kitchen and the server.  One person in our group ordered the dolsot bibambap w/o an egg.  All came served with an egg.  No matter, it was quickly fixed, but the next dolsot bowl left a sizzling meal for what was 20 minutes.  It's great that food comes out hot - that should be the goal!  However, it rendered the meal inedible for a long period of time.  There are worse problems to have, but this stuck out.\n\nOther notes:  Gratuity was included for 6+ guests, which is fine but probably not great for the servers.  The cocktails were slightly overpriced for their quality, but nothing outrageous.  \n\nConclusion:  Southgate is a nice Korean fusion experience for those who want a little adventure, but nothing over the top.

We had made a reservation and were seated right away in a crowded, cozy restaurant. There's bar seating as well as a collection of two-tops that can be pushed together as appropriate, but we wound up in the back at a large table that can seat about 10 people, so we shared our space with another group (shout out to the man next to me that night who now probably knows way more than he cared to know about my friends and me). \n\nThe drink list includes a variety of unique cocktails with an Asian spin. I decided to be adventurous and tried the featured Soju flight, which was pretty good --- I particularly enjoyed the soju with cardamom. My friends tried the Seoul Sour (which was \"more sour\" than my friend expected) and the White Sangria, which was good.\n\nFor our meal, we opted to split several of the small plates. The crispy tofu banchan had a great texture and a delicious sauce, while the eggplant was just okay. We got the Korean Fried Chicken with a mix of soy and spicy sauces, and it was incredible (thanks for the tip, Yelp!). The short-rib steam buns were delicious, and the waiter was nice enough to offer to bring a 3rd bun since the order typically comes with 2. The bassam (pork belly lettuce wraps) were flavorful with fresh lettuce and delicious pickled veggies, and the seafood pajeon pancake was enjoyable as well. My friend who has spent time in Korea overall pointed out that the food was based on traditional foods, but definitely had a unique spin --- but we definitely enjoyed our meal. \n\nI'd definitely love to go back; some of the entrees (including bibimbap and the bulgogi burger) were calling my name.", "extracted_aspects": {"cuisine_category": "Korean-fusion", "cuisine_category_reason": "The review mentions Korean-fusion dishes and traditional Korean foods with a unique spin.", "specific_dishes_or_attributes": "The Korean Fried Chicken was incredible, while the eggplant was just okay.", "visit_purpose": "Social gathering with friends.", "visit_purpose_reason": "The review indicates it was a 'Girls' Night dinner' with friends.", "quality_criteria": "The crispy tofu banchan had a great texture and a delicious sauce, while the eggplant was just okay.", "visit_context": "Visited with friends and made a reservation.", "visit_context_reason": "The diner visited with a couple of friends and made a reservation."}}, {"review_id": "rY4uqThNkB6p9wIJSjTyDQ", "item_id": "68ThEdiK0eWCEgGEmV9Tng", "user_id": "pK2w9UgmSe-cSqIScplZKg", "rating": 4.0, "timestamp": "2019-04-05 15:26:01", "review_text": "I know that the concept of Southgate is Korean with an American style, but to be honest I'd say it's the other way around. I felt like I was eating mostly American food influenced by Korean cuisine.  For an appetizer, I ordered the octopus and dduk skewers (unfortunately gobbled it down before getting a picture) but you should know that there were only two pieces and there was only one piece of the octopus confit on each skewer (which was the best part).  The dduk was a little tough - there's a way to cook dduk crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which is what they were going for and did an ok job of.\n\nThe galbi we ordered was really good, but again I really wouldn't have called it galbi.  If you served this to me and I didn't know what the dish was called or where it came from, I would've never suspected it to be Korean.  That being said though, it was really good though just judging it based on its stand alone quality. The meat was really tender and the marinade was delicious, but again I just had to laugh a little at how it was supposed to be remotely Korean.\n\nI also got a beef dolsot bibimbap, and it was really good but also bibimbap is low key one of those things you can't really mess up.  I wish they put a little more of a finishing sesame oil drizzle and more spicy gochujang but overall it was satisfying.\n\nI also ordered a soju flight (they house infuse their sojus) and they were all pretty pleasant and worth a try if you've never had soju before. It's a very impressionable spirit and takes on the flavor of whatever is in it easily, so it may feel a little like drinking juice but the flavor combos were interesting and my partner and I did enjoy them.\n\nService was great, and because of the lovely weather we asked to be seated outside and were able to, so I didn't see much of the interior space. \n\nI think just all in all, it truly was a three and a half to a four star restaurant experience because it's not that the food wasn't good - I just think if you are craving Korean, skip this place. \n\nAnother little tip: don't get the kimchi it was foul.

Our waiter was impressively attentive to our table even though it was a busy night with full tables and a line for takeout.

They also took precautions by wearing masks, using paper menus, and wiping down tables. \n\n2) FOOD: I had the happy hour burger of the day (kimchi burger) and southgate fries (garlic, gochugaru, gochujang aioli) to share. At first I thought I was saving a lot more, but it seems like their $16 regular menu burger includes fries whereas the $10 happy hour burger doesn't. From a happy hour perspective, you save $2 on banchan and $2 if you order the burger and fries separately. I didn't really get why the $4 mystery beer was in the happy hour menu since it's also $4 in their regular drink menu. Anyway, the food was solid. I'd describe it as Korean-American grub with a contemporary twist. The southgate fries were my favorite -- they had that honey garlicky smell that I love and there was more than enough for 2 to share. The burger was also well portioned, and I think people will appreciate the fusion element with the kimchi. However I wish there was more flavor from the patty or the cheese, since it seemed like the kimchi was the unilateral star of the show. \n\nOverall this was a great experience and I will be back to try other things on the menu.

I've walked by it countless times, but only just made the time to give it a whirl. The gray-toned palette skips between matte and glossy finishes to compliment dim mood lighting. The walls are decked with a chic take on subway tile. Exposed HVAC, incandescent bumps, and twinkle lights dangle tastefully from the ceiling. Hours and specials are chalked onto a board at the head of the sleek bar that extends the length of the restaurant.\n\nMy partner and I swung by for early weekend dinner and arrived in time for happy hour. We opted for the Banchan Set, the Bulgogi and Pork Steamed Buns, the Korean Fried Chicken, and the Bulgogi Burger (which came with a draft, as part of HH). Of the banchan, my favorites were the zucchini and tofu, both cooked in a rich soy-based sauce and served hot. On the other hand, the kimchi and cucumbers were lukewarm and standard, if not boring. Each dish was large, and I recognize that Southgate is not an authentic Korean restaurant; yet, it still felt off-script for Southgate to charge for banchan. The two-biter buns both had a pillowy bun and nice spicy mayo. While spicy pork was flavorful (and particularly heavy on the sesame), the bulgogi felt dry. Both KFC glazes were yummy with a remarkable depth of flavor (even though the \"spicy\" was not particularly hot). However, they ran a tad soggy with a laughable tiny portion (7 small wings) for the price. The burger was rich, juicy, thick, and heavy, complemented nicely by the tang of pickles and subtly spicy aioli. but was paired with a flimsy bun and flimsier steakhouse fries (I really wish they were shoestring, instead).\n\nAt $56 (after tax and tip) despite the happy hour deals, Southgate definitely errs on the expensive end. Although nothing was actively negative about my experience here, nothing floored me either. As a whole, Southgate definitely rings more American food than Korean -- so if you have a hankering for Korean comfort food, this probably won't do the trick.

From 5-7PM on weekdays AND 2-7 on weekends, Southgate offers both food and drink deals with their indoor and outdoor seating. We strolled by on probably the hottest day of the year and decided to eat outside - probably not the smartest idea, but it actually wasn't as bad as expected with a slight breeze coming in from the street. The outdoor seating was nice and isolated from the street with the covered seating, and the tables were nicely spaced from other diners. And luckily, not many others were as crazy as us to sit outside, so very few people were outside. Our waiter was very attentive to us, making sure our water was always filled especially in the heat. \n\nOf course, we were there for happy hour, and they definitely had a good number of deals available. I opted for the $16 burger and beer. I could chose any beer so opted for a tangerine pale ale, which was very refreshing. The burger was slated for the bulgogi burger, which was excellent - there was a good bit of sauce that made the bun a little soggy, but the flavors were on point. The brioche bun was hefty enough to hold up the contents, and the burger patty itself was very substantial. The burger also came with their homemade fries - thick cut, well seasoned, and plentiful, they were great! For $16, it was an awesome deal! My fiancee got the $4 draft beer of the day, which was a watermelon ale. Very refreshing as well! He got the $10 burger of the day, the kimchi burger - he loved it!! There was a ton of kimchi on the burger, and the kimchi was very good - nice level of spice, crunchy veggies, and bacon, a unique taste. He was a big fan! While his didn't come with fries, luckily I had plenty to share so we splitsies. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our happy hour meal at Southgate - the deals were on point, and the food was good! While it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, it was quite a unique take and the deals couldn't be beat. We hope to make it back for another HH to try more of their offerings, and to try their Korean fried chicken, which seems to be highly regarded.

I've frequented this location about 3 or 4 times within the past month. For starters, it's definitely much different than the Chinatown location. Firstly, it's a lot more of an open and quiet layout, which is nice if you want a more intimate experience. However, i do enjoy the more party-like vibes of Chinatown sometimes. I do like this location for more relaxed nights. Second, parking in this location is definitely much easier than it is in Chinatown. \n\nI've had many experiences, all of which have been similar. It's usually been pretty empty when I've come, and I've never had to wait to be seated which is very nice. All of the waiters and waitresses I've had have been pretty friendly. My order consistently stays the same; I ordered a small traditional wings, half spicy and half soy garlic. I usually order seasoned fries on the side as well. \n\nIn terms of food quality, it has varied a little bit across the board. Nothing has changed drastically, but I was super happy with the size of the wings during my first few experiences. More recently, however, I feel some of them were very scrawny and small. The crunch is always great and never disappoints. I also did notice in my most recent experience that my fries could have been filled a little more. I know this is somewhat dumb of a complaint; however, the fries are 8 dollars, so I better be getting a decent portion. Nevertheless, I have never ever left Bonchon without being very full.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with this location. The servers are always very nice, and I like that this more quiet, open, and more relaxed location is an option for some chiller nights. This doesn't take away from the fact that I love the Chinatown location. I do also think that this spot will get busier once summer ends, and University City kids go back to school.

So, maybe they are talking about the immense quality of their pies. Some people seem to like them a lot, but they have never been nominated as among the best pizza in this city. After grabbing a quick dinner there last week of their Steak Royal sandwich, Caesar Salad and Quesadilla at very reasonable prices, I can only conclude that the value offered by the quantity and quality vectors from the kitchen makes dining there a pretty big deal if your fortunate enough to find an empty table. \n\nMy Steak Royal was enough for two people with ordinary appetites, with a load of chopped ribeye, onions, sweet & hot peppers and a splash of red sauce. Of course, the bread makes the sandwich, and their bakery provider has taken good care of them with a premium crunchy torpedo that really came back to life with a few moments in the oven to turn the package into a crispy grinder. It was very good. The cheese Quesadilla was decent, too, but the need for simplicity kept it from being a standout. There is only so much you can do with a single ingredient grilled cheese, even when found in a hot tortilla. Such is the effect of dietary restrictions. The Caesar was mega large in a big bowl, but little more than romaine, tomato, feta, red onion shavings, a sprinkle of parmesan and a plastic cup of Caesar dressing. It wasn't so much that we couldn't finish it, but more that we not motivated to do so. It was fresh, but fairly generic.\n\nWith a third mouth to fill, we would have ordered a small pizza, too, but we did not need it for the two of us. That will have to wait for another visit.

I just figured I was in the famous Reading Market so everything must be good. I was so, so incredibly wrong.\n\nEating a Spataro's Cheesesteak is low key my fault. As stated, I did not check my trusty Yelp app for the best cheesesteak options within the market. I also noticed Spataro's line was leaps and bounds shorter than Carmen's. See, if I were a true foodie, I would have known to go with the longer line. However, I was lazy and impatient. You can take my foodie card whenever you please, I understand. \n\nI ordered three cheesesteaks: one wit(h) onions, mushrooms & provolone, one wit(h) onions & provolone, and one wit(h) onions, mushrooms and wit(h) onions, mushrooms & cheese whiz. (I'm throwing out the wits simply because I want the respect of native Philadelphians.) I also had two sides of fries. The line was slow moving - but nearly everything with a line in Reading is. You have to be patient and hope to be rewarded with excellent food. For nearly every stall here, that will be the case. For Spataro's...not so much. \n\nThere didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason as to how the sandwiches were coming out. People before me waited longer than people behind me. I couldn't comprehend it as everything that I saw on the flat top was steak. We're all ordering the same thing; what gives? I eventually received all my food and sat down with my family.\n\nI don't know if this is typical of Philly cheesesteak, but boy - these babies were dry and bland. I noticed the DeNic's roast pork also seemed to be missing some lubricant so I tried to chalk it up to a Philly preference. That being said, these sandwiches desperately needed seasoning. The veggies and cheese were practically non-existent. In order for that to be okay the meat needed to really shine. If you aren't aware, cheesesteak meat is typically thinly sliced ribeye. Because it's being cooked well done, it needs to be seasoned well and made by someone who knows what they're doing. It's blatantly obvious that Spataro's is just throwing whoever back there because the meat was borderline crispy and dreadfully dull. I had to hunt down some mayo just to get the sandwich down. I'm that type of person who will suffer through mundane food if I bought it myself. Remember guys, I just finished college. The pocketbooks aren't exactly overflowing at the moment.\n\nDo yourself a favor and skip Spataro's. Go to Carmen's. Or better yet, venture to Reading Terminal for anything but cheesesteaks. Take a hike over to one of the OG spots like Pat's or Geno's so you can get an authentic cheesesteak experience and make a sound decision on whether or not you actually like them.

Overall, I would say what I found most disappointing was that it took 45 minutes to get bread on the table and about 58 minutes before we received the appetizer course, which was a little annoying because the restaurant made a big deal of us being there at 5 p.m. but then didn't do anything with us for a long time once we arrived even though the restaurant was otherwise empty.  By the time the main course was served, all our guests had already drunk their wine, so they had no wine to accompany the main course.  I will say again that there were no complaints about the food ... it was the best part, when in finally came!  Also, the ambiance of the restaurant was nice.

Branzino is a beautifully elegant, classic Italian restaurant with great service and food, where I had one of the best meals I have ever had in Philadelphia, from beginning to end. 7 courses described below.\n\nWe arrived at this BYOB last night, pleasantly surprised by it's beautiful open floor to ceiling windows and street seating. On this Sunday evening, there was plenty of seating so we were able to choose whether to sit in the beautiful courtyard with string lights or on the street. There was so much available seating at 7:00pm that a quick concern arose, but after all, it is a pandemic. We chose the street seating that was separated from the street by beautiful planters.\n\nWe decided to treat ourselves to two dishes from each part of the menu- each of us had four courses.\n\nWe started with the oysters and artichokes. My boyfriend loved the oysters, saying they were so fresh. We both also loved the artichokes- both delicious. We moved on to cacio pepe and mushroom ravioli. Both excellent. For entrees, we had the pork chop and duck breast. These truly exceeded our expectations. Both were amazing. The pork over a kale with pine nuts and the duck with radicchio and peach mostarda. It's the way that each of these dish's flavors and textures were balanced- with savory, tangy, sweet, bitter, crunchy, while the meat was prepared to the perfect temperature. \n\nFor desert we had the chocolate olive oil cake. It was good, perhaps not as much of a standout to me, as all the other dishes. But still enjoyed and finished all of it. \n\nService was excellent. I will definitely go back.

Unfortunately, that's about the extent of the positives at this place. \n\nA group of 5 of us went and each of us left unhappy. It was a Wednesday night with only a handful of other tables in the entire restaurant. One would think with it being a slow night that things would go smoothly, right? \n\nWe were greeted by the host and while midway walking us to our table decided to leave and help another customer. We were left standing awkward in the middle of the dining room. Normally I wouldn't care, but the guy didn't even come back. We had to ask someone else to figure out where the table was. \n\nWe got to our table and a few moments later the waiter approaches --- it was the host! I guess he was assuming both roles for the night. He told us briefly about the menu and the several items they were out of (their menu is small to begin with, but being a pandemic I can understand). We placed our order and then continued on with the evening. \n\nNow onto the entrees. The first thing the waiter came out with was the branzino which he began fileting table side. About a minute later another waiter came out with  our pasta dishes. Someone in my party ordered scallops, but she was brought pasta . The waiter acknowledged it was his mistake and that he \"couldn't read his writing. \"  Her pasta was taken away and only three of the five of us had our entrees in front of us. Being polite, we were waiting to eat until everyone had their food. The waiter continued trying to filet the branzino table side for what felt like an eternity. I don't know if it was his first day, but this was unbelievable. It probably took at least ten minutes for him to finish. By that point the entrees on the table were cold and there was still no scallops to be seen. Four of the five of us decided to go ahead and eat. The food was subpar at best. We all finished our food before the other person in the party even got her scallops. They eventually came and those too were disappointing. \n\nThe portions sizes were very small and since we were all still hungry we decided to press our luck with dessert. We all had our eyes on burnt marshmallow budino. But guess what? They don't have it anymore! They replaced it with a banana pudding thing that did not sound appetizing at all. We picked something else and the desserts came out. The waiter decided to bring us the banana dessert to try it out.

One of the best in the city where the cheese was melted in with the meat, which made every bite better then the first. Next on the list to try is their Cheesesteak Verdi and Diavolo jawn ! \n\n* Chicken Cutlet Lagasse~ Out of all of their cutlet sandwiches this is a must order. I added broccoli rabe to this already awesome sandwich that has prosciutto, long hots and sharp provolone in it. \n\n* The Sicilian~ Another must order if you are a fan of prosciutto, mortadella, sharp provolone, hot capicola, and soppressata. All tucked in a seeded role with long hots, with oil and balsamic dressed over top.\n\n* The Godfather~ Basically I was made an offer I couldn't refuse. Yes I dropped to a knee and kissed the ring with this masterpiece. Nothing compares or can even come close to what I am about to try to explain to you. Picture that perfect seeded roll stuffed with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, soppressata, green olives, fresh basil, with an aged balsamic. I went a step further and added long hots to this marvel. Hence the Godfather.   \n\nCosmi's is in my top 3 out of 5 for an amazing hoagie, and in my top 5 for that bomb ass cheesesteak.

They said they were out of bagels so I took regular toast instead. 70 minutes later, my food arrived. It was missing the fruit salad, which was weird, because it looked like the driver was checking the order in his car before bringing it my door. The order list stapled to the bag had three items--but not the fruit salad--checked off. I called and was told someone would bring the fruit salad out. 45 minutes later, I called again, and they said it should be there in a few minutes. 30 minutes after that, the fruit salad arrived.

Yelpers are the wisest people!!!!\n\nNow back to my regularly scheduled review of last night's meal...\n\nService 10/5\n\nSpecial thanks to JOSE B who patiently took my order and well, he made my night..\n\nHave you ever had one of those weeks where one thing added a tinge of grey to your otherwise sunny outlook? I'd one of those weeks where a lot of great things happened but my mind chose to dwell on the one or two negative things that happened instead of my many awesome blessings. Maybe I'm not as thick skinned as I once thought, or maybe I'm re-connecting with my own humanity. Either way i was feeling blue and talking abt it didn't help. My solution to seeing the cup half empty was to make an unplanned stop at shake shack! Yeah a meal after a day of being stuck to and starved at my desk b/c i forgot my pass and work bestie and favorite lunch buddy took a day off and i didn't want to deal with the workplace temp pass security issues, so it was water for me till the the proverbial bell rang yabadabadoo! So I was very hungry by 6pm. \n\nBack to my Shake Shack experience...\nSo all it took was a little red wine and a very kind, smart counter gentleman named JOSE B. to set the stage to change my attitude and also the delicious burger helped!\n\nFood 6/5\nIn my case? It was a delicious...\n\n...double Shack burger no cheese with everything on it, but sauce on the side and no salt 6/5\n\nPeople! Order it \"well\" with no salt and get the shake shack special sauce on the side! You will not be disappointed! Maybe it was the $8.99 glass of red wine (which was very good)  I had on an empty stomach while i waited but I gotta tell you, the burger was yumliciious! Yes that's the red wine talking, I never say yumilicious out loud or even to myself but who cares? I'm happily broadcasting it publicly this eve!\n\nFries 5/5\nNo salt and yes they listened and they are perfect. smaller serving than I remembered but I'm okay with that. I tend to finish everything on my plate so less is more. Also I saw someone leave some of their fries and thought hey, I'm kinda full I'm gonna leave some too. So sadly I'm going to not over fill my belly (I'm pretty full though tbh) and yes one of the floor servers politely offered to clear my tray and chucked the rest on my behalf, not sure i could have done it on my own.\n\nI'm mourning the end of my meal now not my formerly negative affect. Thanks to Jose B. who patiently took my order and made me realize not all people suck when it's really only one person outside in my non shake shack real world life who kind of wasn't nice earlier in the week. Thanks Jose you give me hope, not all men are insensitive! :) \n\nYes i let the behavior of one acquaintance whom I'll never see again ruin my mood for five days. \n\nBack to food...So now I'm in mourning  b/c i finished my delicious double burger no cheese cooked well. So my negative affect is gone thanks to shake shack and their kind customer service (standing ovation to Jose and team at shake shack)and delicious food (order no salt and well done and you'll be so happy). So here's the hard part...\n\nI gave up on my plan to kick carbs to the side of the road till Thanksgiving. Life's too short and in the words of Yelp friend Amy M..,.carbs=happiness!\n\nIn summary JOSE B!!! Man you made my night!\nJOSE B. at the counter took excellent care of me. Sometimes a guy in tune with humanity can see when a person is out of sorts and just that little bit of TLC changes a stranger's perspective!

And interestingly enough, the majority of these shops are family enterprises! The history extends back to the 1970s in Jersey, when three enterprising cousins began Pat's Pizza. As the family itself expanded, siblings and cousins became owners of separate branches, with each individual making it their own. \n\nSouth Street was graced with a Pat's a little over a year ago and it's already becoming popular with folks popping in to grab a few slices or ordering in. I recently had the opportunity to check out their menu, and it definitely features more than just pizza. \n\nBoneless Wings | Buffalo Chicken Calzone | Tortelloni Alfredo | Mozzarella Sticks\n\nA standard order for me includes boneless wings (boneless to cater to the wife!). Pat's did not disappoint. I appreciated the crispness of the batter, encasing juicy morsels of fresh chicken. Loved the vinegar emanating from the mild buffalo sauce - perfect to dunk in sauce studded with chunks of blue cheese. A guilty pleasure of mine? Buffalo chicken calzones. The medium-sized calzone at Pat's will easily service 3 or more, oozing plenty of cheese and chunks of buffalo chicken. The sleeper hit at Pat's and an absolute must? The pastas. Do check out the tortelloni or the fettucine alfredo. That sauce is pure decadence, redolent with plenty of cheese and begging for you to mop it all up with bread. And yes, mozzarella sticks are solid here at Pat's ... gooey, crispy, and served with the requisite marinara. \n\nPat's Special Burger\n \nPat's special burger is housed in a Le Bus bun, airy and light. The burger itself is char-grilled and juicy, topped with onion rings, crisp bacon, and plenty of American cheese. Tasty! \n\nLarge Pepperoni Pizza\n\nCircular and square slices are both available at Pat's. A crisp crust offers a vessel to house sweet marinara and cheese. Studded with plenty of pepperoni, this hit the spot. \n\nSo if you get a chance, be sure to check out Pat's on South Street.

I was first made aware of this place by virtue of the fact that it's a vegetarian place however V street could mean any number of things. \"Vegetarian\" is not the only word that begins with \"V\" if you know what I mean. \n\nFurther investigation indicates the theme of this place is vegetarian street food from a bunch of different places. INTERESTING. What a great idea, if only I had thought of that shit first. \n\nTinatron and I schlepped our way over to rittenhouse on a Sunday evening dangerously close to xmas. We classically walked both a block too far west and too far south. No problem. We eventually made our way to the entrance. All the tables were occupied but we scooted into 2 spots on the \"bar\" at the window in the front. \n\nDrink menu contains a bunch of good, juicy shit. Shit I just accidentally clicked on the brunch menu and good god I almost got off. Anyways the drink menu, like the rest of the menu, is mouth-watering. I went with the Hong Kong Karaoke with rum, apple brandy, caramel miso shrub, and cider. How could I resist a beverage with caramel miso SHRUB? What on earth? It was delicious. Tinasaurus ordered a beverage that I do not recall but it was good enough that she got 2 or 3. \n\nThe fucking food menu is outrageous. For starters, one of the menu categories is titled \"NOODS\" (LOL). I severely struggled deciding what in god's name we should order. After some serious fucking deliberation we ultimately pulled the trigger on, to split, the za'atar brussels sprouts salad, peruvian fries, korean fried tempeh tacos, and the pho noodles. \n\nI, like the rest of the world apparently, simultaneously, have become absolutely unwaveringly obsessed with fucking brussels sprouts. So basic. Where did they come from? Despite the fact that I prefer the shavings, this salad is a conglomeration of some sprout balls, a cauliflower floret or two, zhoug (whatever the fuck that is), some pink shit (might be the zhoug), and hummus/\"whipped tahini\" occupying the border. Delicious. \n\nPeruvian potatoes were long and thick (wink) instead of the long and thin/crispy that I tend to prefer. Delicious seasoning. Had to cut them with a knife for eating in public/etiquette purposes but I suppose one would be capable of stuffing one in their mouth should they find themselves utensil-less. This was a good call that I would recommend however next time I might prefer to try something else. \n\nTempeh tacos were delicious. I happen to be particularly enthusiastic regarding tempeh's texture to begin with. Sriracha thousand island dressing, to die. \n\nPho was good also, that broth...MM! I definitely went to town and turned the waiter away when he tried to pry the bowl from my grip with some broth remaining. \n\nI forgot about dessert again. The dessert menu had me at \"halva ice cream\" on top of the waffle with chocolate ganache (aka chocolate syrup, let's be real with ourselves) and cherries. DUMB good. I had no problem picking up Tina's slack when she could no longer fit anything in that stomach. \n\nAnyways this place was amazing. I can't wait to return to try some more delicious vegetarian (is that really what the v stands for tho?) street shit.\n\nUPDATE: when my veggie friend came to visit, I had to bring her to this place. The you-fucked-up-and-came-without-a-reservation situation isn't that bad actually, they text you when your table is ready and you have 10 min to make it over. \n\nContrary to the only thing I said I might not order again, the Peruvian potatoes were the only thing I DID order again and they did not disappoint. I liked them even more the second time.\n\nWe also went with Grilled Broccoli (delicious), Harissa Grilled Tofu (drooling at the memory with that fucking dope-ass tomato sauce and croutons) and cauliflower tacos (DEAD.

Prior to dining there with an accomplished vegan Chef in his own right, I had simply pronounced the restaurant's name as V Street - no pause. The pronunciation is a straight forward declaration of place. Fitting as V Street is a destination  worthy of being placed on a map - as in \"Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?\" \n\nExpanding on the role of all routes on a map, V Street is both a destination and a thoroughfare - an ending and a journey. The journey is a celebration of the beautiful diversity of vegetables and ways that humans prepare, and enjoy, them throughout the world. Which brings us to the second pronounciation which is V, Street. \n\nThis pronounciation leads us to understand that V Street is not a named road, but instead a letter, \"V\", modified by an adjective, \"Street\".  The Street is of course describing the street foods that inspire the entire menu and becomes the larger vehicle to understand the course of your meal. Embracing the origin of each dish's street food origin allows you to better connect the flavors to a place and a culture.  This significant pronounciation would have been lost on me had I not been dining with my chef friend.\n\nThe V is an abbreviation, and though it works to assume that the V is a stand in for vegetable or vegan, I'm going to take the V as a diminutive for Vedge the more upscale restaurant where Chef Rich Landau and Chef Kate Jacoby also serve, surprise, and convert people with their vegan culinary creations.\n\nMy friend also has been studying and preparing vegan food for decades. He has enjoyed meals at V Street many times. Thus I was in the fortunate position of benefiting from his ordering approach - which it turns out will be quite easy for me to pass on to you - he simply ordered the first 8, smaller, dishes on the menu for us to share. I was satisfied of hunger within the first 4 dishes, but never quelled my appetite for biting into the next melange of new flavor combinations.\n\nHere is what we had with my tasting notes:\n\n* Kung Pao Cucumbers - crisp, fresh, spicy\n\n* Grilled Broccolli - hearty, springy, earthy, choose if you like grilled flavors\n\n* Za'taar Brussels Sprouts Salad\n\n* Carrot Asado, earthy, smoky, again choose if you like grilled flavors\n\n* Cauliflower \"65\" Tacos \n\nI very much enjoyed all of the dishes above, but I've saved my favorite two dishes for last and they happen to be what I considered to be my entree and dessert. The fact I enjoyed these two dishes the most AND I ate them when completely full is another mark in their flavor.\n\n* Korean Fried Tempeh Tacos - I am not vegan. I live in Los Angels and am an amateur fish taco lover seeking out the best fish tacos in Los Angeles, Encinitas, and Ensenada. I could easily give up fish and switch over to these fried tempeh tacos, they are as good as the best Baja style fish tacos and better than any but the best.\n\n* Halo Halo - an oddly elaborate Filipino sweet street food that is presented as a sundae and seems more fit for a king than for a pedestrian. Purple sweet potato (ube) ice \"cream\", orange granita (shaved frozen ice), coconut whip, and pickled pineapple all go into this concoction.

Prior to my recent weekend trip to Philly, I had bookmarked V Street & Wiz Kid without realizing they are directly next to each other and connected from the inside. What a pleasant surprise it was when I realized that I could try both spots for take-out with ease. \n\nLet me start off by saying the service I received at V Street was absolutely excellent. I ordered take-out (3 items) directly from the host, who was an extremely kind gentleman (I wished I caught his name)! He was working the evening shift on March 9th, a Friday night, when I visited. He took my order and then gave me updates while I waited. He was clearly extremely busy, as the restaurant is rather small and it was a Friday night (it was packed) but he remained polite and kind to me the entire time. I really appreciated his service. \n\nThe FOOD! I was ordering take-out with my mom, who is not a lover of anything spicy. I, on the other hand, adore spicy food, but I went with not so spicy items to appease my mom. We went with: The Zhoug Avocado (flatbread, grilled eggplant, tahini, pickled turnip), Peruvian Fries (aji amarillo, cilantro, dried olive, peanuts), and Miso Butter Noodles (pickled ginger, nori, cracked pepper). Here is my review in the order in which we adored them:\n\n1) Miso Butter Noodles- wow, these were flavorful! For anyone who is a lover of the simple things like traditional butter noodles, but looking for a way to spice it up a bit- these noodles are for you. They were the perfect consistency (texture of noodle wise) that we all know and love, had the salty kick from the sprinkle of nori and the miso, the buttery and creamy kick in the sauce, a kick of flavor with some ginger and the cracked pepper tried everything together. I was honestly surprised how much I loved these, considering they weren't spicy at all and I typically prefer spice, especially with Asian noodle dishes. My mom loved this dish as well, we both decided it was our favorite. \n\n2) The Zhoug Avocado- this flatbread was delicious. It was a small portion for the cost, honestly, as we received 4 pieces of flatbread. However, the flavor on this puppy was crazy good. The flavors mended so well together- the fresh and savory flatbread with the grilled eggplant and the creamy avocado with the pickled turnip on top. We loved this dish.\n\n3) Peruvian Fries- just because these were rated #3 out of 3 does not mean we didn't enjoy them.. because these guys were packed with flavor. When they say 'fries' please understand these are potato wedges- they are huge. The dried olives I thought I would HATE, but NOPE. They added a nice salty kick and a depth of flavor that complimented the fresh cilantro and peanuts with the spicy-ish sauce. The sauce was very good, but do keep in mind it was a little spicy. My mom who is sensitive to spice could eat it though, which means it wasn't too bad. Overall, these were super tasty.\n\nOur order took approx. 15-20 minutes from start to finish.

However I did have the opportunity to sample a good portion of the menu so I will try to give a fair assessment from an omnivore's perspective. \n\nWe started our meal with the Bahn Mi Salad, Kung Pao Cucumbers, Peruvian potatoes, and Califlower 65.  I enjoyed the kung pao cucumbers and Califlower 65, both were prepared in such a way that reminded me of very similar Chinese and Indian flavors that I've had in the past.  I however thought the bahn mi salad was missing the subtly pungent flavors of fish sauce and pickled radish that I've come to expect with almost every bahn me I've ever had.  I thought also that the Peruvian potatoes were a bit too heavy from being fried and not too much flavor.\n\nOur second courses included the Miso butter noodles, spicy Dan Dan noodles, and the KFT tacos.  Of these the spicy noodles were my favorite since it had a good mixture of flavor, and spice, and the fried mushrooms on top were fantastic.  The KFT tacos were ok, but I did not think the fried tempeh was best served in a soft taco shell.  I feel like a hard shell would have been better to contrast the textures a little more since the tempeh itself did not have much flavor.  However the one dish we all thought missed the mark a little was the miso butter noodles.  it was way over salted to our tastes and not a favorite.  My dinner companion and I thought maybe some kind of binder like sesame paste or something would help cut through some of the saltiness.\n\nOur dessert of sweet potato turn over was great as it was not too sweet, and had almost a pumpkin pie taste to it.  Drinks and service were both very good.\n\nSo as an omnivore, I was thinking for most of my meal \"where is the beef\":-)  and \"boy is that a lot of starch\", and \"man some of this stuff is really salty\".

But for this experience, the mission was all about the taste of the WizKid Philly.\n\nI re-heated the sandwich in the oven at home, and generally I think that worked well, except that the  rutabaga \"wiz\" pooled to the crease of the bread, so it probably wasn't distributed through the sandwich properly. The grilled seitan, mushrooms and onions were excellent - really well-seasoned, cooked right, and great flavors. Just the right amount of grease, like you would want to have with a real cheesesteak. And when I managed to get some wiz on a bite, the sharp bite of the rutabaga made it even better. The roll was a great vehicle for this kind of sandwich - sturdy enough to handle the mounds of fillings without making it too \"bready.\"\n\nSo overall, this is a pretty tasty sandwich, and lighter than any cheesesteak I've ever had (it sneaks up on you though - you feel a lot more full than you were expecting about an hour after finishing the meal). But can I say that I've finally found a worthy vegetarian substitute for the Philly cheesesteaks I used to love so long ago? Not really. I think I'm going to give up that search, because it seems the intrinsic qualities of meat which make a real cheesesteak great can't ever be replicated by vegan alternatives. Still a good sandwich, but I had my last real cheesesteak almost 8 years ago, and the memory is still strong enough that I can tell the difference.\n\nNext time I want to give the smoked tofu reuben a try. Reubens seem a lot easier to veganize, and I'm optimistic that V Street will make a great version of it too.", "extracted_aspects": {"cuisine_category": "Vegan", "cuisine_category_reason": "The diner specifically mentions trying a vegan cheesesteak, indicating a preference for vegan cuisine.", "specific_dishes_or_attributes": "The grilled seitan, mushrooms, and onions were excellent - really well-seasoned, cooked right, and great flavors.", "visit_purpose": "To try the Wiz Kid vegan cheesesteak.", "visit_purpose_reason": "The diner aimed to try the famous Wiz Kid vegan cheesesteak.", "quality_criteria": "The sandwich was tasty and lighter than any cheesesteak the diner had ever had, but the diner felt that the intrinsic qualities of meat which make a real cheesesteak great can't ever be replicated by vegan alternatives.", "visit_context": "The diner visited the restaurant yesterday afternoon and ordered the food to go.", "visit_context_reason": "The diner visited the restaurant yesterday afternoon and ordered the food to go."}}, {"review_id": "bidbKPwI9XULjboH5fzJGw", "item_id": "E_h2yNoagLK-3ODYwMPErw", "user_id": "DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw", "rating": 5.0, "timestamp": "2019-03-12 14:51:43", "review_text": "I LOVED this place when I came here last year, so I knew when I was back in Philly that I had to come here again.

The service we got is 1 star but I can't honestly diss the restaurant for a pillock of a server so 4 stars it will be.\n\nMy late friend David was a long time vegetarian who was considering becoming vegan. David was a sweet man who was a lazy, lousy cook. He lived on a small fixed income so our friend network always looked for opportunities to expand his dining experiences. I took him here for a birthday dinner after a ballet performance at the Academy.\n\nThe seating is a bit cramped and the space is noisy so those aspects can make dining here celebratory and festive or a royal PITA, depending on the occasion and your perspective. The menu also tends to be mostly small plates, so if you're at a 2 top, your table real estate can fill up quickly. \n\nWe began with non-alcoholic tea drinks which don't come with refills. V Street has the ubiquitous kombucha but to me, no matter who makes it and irregardless of the ingredients, it always tastes like vinegar. Can't comment on V Street's state or mastery of this potion; just stating my feelings. \n\nVegan food is labor intensive, not \"just vegetables,\" and cooking to make it palatable to main stream, dairy loving and carnivorous taste buds is most definitely in the realm of cunning stunts that V Street has artfully mastered. The food here is marvelous in every sense of that word.\n\nHow can one not order the Peruvian fries?  Tasty, faux junk foody and more-ish. You don't get large portions here, so even though (I believe) the food is meant to be shared, it also feels like the portions are calculated on the 'just barely big enough for two' side to encourage additional consumption/ordering. We threw Dan Dan noodles in the mix, too. If you are spice averse, these shouldn't be part of your order as V Street does not kid around with spicing. Since David was a portly gent who loved his food, we also put tempeh tacos, carrot asado, trumpet mushroom shwarma and charred broccoli in for the birthday feast.  Our server seemed harried, annoyed with us and life in general and not very accommodating. David had a lot of questions about the menu and she was not especially interested in answering most of them. As our orders  came out, she made no effort to clear empties off the table. She also did not tell us which dish was being served. Now, you might be sitting there thinking, \"Uh-Warren, what dullard can't tell that someone just put a plate of potatoes on the table?!\" This is not a cows and tubers joint, thank you very much. When you are being served things that might be unfamiliar to you in your daily life (assuming you are not strictly vegan and even then...), it's a nicety to be told, \"Here are the Dan Dan noodles,\" or \"This is the charred broccoli with berbere.\" And ask then, \"any questions? No? Enjoy!\" or something along those lines. \n\nWe reached a point where we considered moving the spent plates to the unoccupied table next to us to give us more elbow room. We were raised better than that, though, so we didn't. \n\nAs a mushroom lover, I was especially looking forward to the trumpet mushroom shwarma. When our unhappy hipster waitress finally started clearing away plates, I asked her when this dish would be coming out. She gave me an icy look and said we'd already eaten it. I've been in the food industry, front and back of house, and hate to be a thorn in anyone's side, but I knew this was not so. I said I was so sorry to disagree, but that was not the case. She said I should count the plates and reach into my memory for what I ate as she continued to buss the table. Nothing in the least apologetic in her manner. No offer to look into it. Clearly, in her tiny bit of waitress pond, the customer is not always right and is also quite full of crap. Sorry-no mushrooms of any sort ever graced our table. David was looking embarrassed and since it was his birthday, it seemed best not to make a fuss. \n\nWe both ordered the soft serve for dessert. It was nothing special. I made a ruse with David of excusing myself for ablutions and went to discreetly find the waitress to ask that the mushroom dish be removed from the check. She was hotly insistent that she served it and said \"it was on a dark plate.\" Honey, ALL the plates were dark. I walked away. Mad. The dish that was never served remained on the (substantial) check, I paid and left a mid-level tip. We continued on to go and meet other friends for drinking and more festivities.\n\nMy unpleasant encounter aside, this is a fun, lively place if you are new to  veganism or if you want to change up your meat eating routine. It's not a place for a budget meal, but it's a worthy splurge if this is a new way of eating for you, a friend or-what a concept-your parents. : )\n\nI keep wanting to go back for the Whiz Kid Philly meal (vegan cheese steak with all the accoutrements), but this incident is still stuck in my craw and my feet won't let me go in V Street's direction, no matter how hard I try to push them there.", "extracted_aspects": {"cuisine_category": "Vegan", "cuisine_category_reason": "The review discusses vegan food and mentions specific vegan dishes, indicating a preference for vegan cuisine.", "specific_dishes_or_attributes": "The Peruvian fries are tasty, faux junk foody and more-ish.", "visit_purpose": "Birthday celebration", "visit_purpose_reason": "The diner took their friend David out for a birthday dinner.", "quality_criteria": "The food is marvelous, but the service was poor, with an unaccommodating server and issues with order accuracy.", "visit_context": "The diner went with their late friend David after a ballet performance.", "visit_context_reason": "The visit was a birthday dinner for the diner's late friend David after a ballet performance."}}, {"review_id": "0TLSRtSr8Fq0BbLAmMmF8A", "item_id": "E_h2yNoagLK-3ODYwMPErw", "user_id": "cJ2Y8rDqxHMyIXPq5QLPcQ", "rating": 3.0, "timestamp": "2019-05-29 20:02:23", "review_text": "Heard about v streets vegan brunch and their famous whiz kid Philly cheese steak.

Typically a dessert associated with some parts of India, it featured pistachio ice cream (which was absolutely perfect and didn't taste too much of pistachio--a positive), basil seeds that almost look like tiny boba on top, sweetened milk, and probably something that is mildly addictive in there because I could have easily had four of these.

My favorite dish here by a long shot.  Crispy and flavorful with a nice spice.  Yum.  But $14 for 2 tacos was a bit much.  I don't think I have ever seen a $7 taco.\n\nSingapore Noodles - Nothing overly special here.  It was a small portion of delicious noodles with tofu and red curry.

He'd had a vegetarian burrito from there before and wasn't totally enamored, but I was determined to give some of the more interesting menu options a shot. While the menu doesn't immediately seem to offer a whole lot of vegetarian options other than tacos and burritos, if you ask they're able to make vegetarian versions of plenty of other items too! We went with vegetarian enchiladas with the roja sauce, and flautas, which since we asked that they be vegetarian, were filled with cheese instead of chicken.\n\nEverything was ridiculously delicious. The enchiladas are a huge porton, 4 tortillas and served with lots of roasted vegetables, Mexican rice, and heavenly melted cheese over them. They were definitely too huge a portion for either one of us, so it was a good thing we had gotten them to share, along with the flautas. I've had flautas before years ago, and Don Barriga's version was different because the filled tortillas were deep-fried. Turns out that's actually the more standard version, so what I had must have been a weird variation. They were definitely tasty, and the salad-like topping of lettuce, tomato, avocado and crumbled queso was a nice lighter complement to the richness of the flautas themselves.\n\nThe two dishes were way too much for the both of us to finish in a single meal, so we ended up having leftovers (which I supplemented with other items) on Saturday - #YelpsBigNightIn!

The chicken is always well seasoned and flavorful, the meat is not dry.  The tacos are loaded and not shy with the amount of chicken per taco. They are served with limes, radishes and cucumbers and 2 salsas (one mild green salsa and a red smokey spicy salsa). The salsas are both perfection, incredibly flavorful and add such a nice touch to the tacos. \n\nTheir nachos are also delicious. I used to love the nachos at Loco Pez, and don't get me wrong they're still a great option especially on happy hour. But Don Barrigas I find more flavorful, and very generous portions just like Loco Pez. There was a time that my husband and I were starving, so we both ordered an entree and nachos for an appetizer.

Despite the big shoes to fill, Don Barriga does not disappoint. The exterior and interior redecorations revive the space's flair, while the pandemic-safe outdoor setup takes advantage of the wide sidewalk on Spruce. My partner and I capped off our recent bike ride with a trip to Don Barriga. With the wonderful weather, we opted to eat outside. Be warned -- the outdoor seating was open to the elements and might not be too enjoyable on a brisk winter day.\n\nIt's the simple touches that make Don Barriga stand out. Service was prompt without feeling overbearing. The chips and salsa (on the house!) get things started on the ideal note. The chips maintain a nice balance between crisp and sturdy, while the red and green salsa each tote a pleasant depth of flavor. For entrees, I chose the Shrimp Sope, while my partner decided upon the Chicken Mole Enchiladas. The plates run shockingly large. I was basically rolling home afterward. And it's not all just filler -- my sope was a pizza-sized wheel of fried masa, slathered with refried beans and sprinkled with large grilled shrimp. My only critique was that, alone, the dish ran on the dry side, but adding some salsa (and some leftover mole sauce) quickly fixed that. Meanwhile, my partner's (4) enchiladas were bursting with chicken and generously bathed in a sweet-and-savory mole sauce. While I could imagine that a full platter of mole sauce would be overwhelmingly umami, splitting half of it was the perfect amount of richness.\n\nAt ~$30 for two after tax and tip, Don Barriga is an affordable dine-in option certainly worth the investment of the short walk out of University City.", "extracted_aspects": {"cuisine_category": "Mexican", "cuisine_category_reason": "The review mentions 'Mexican cafe' and 'classic eats', indicating a preference for Mexican cuisine.", "specific_dishes_or_attributes": "The Shrimp Sope was described as a pizza-sized wheel of fried masa slathered with refried beans and sprinkled with large grilled shrimp, but it ran on the dry side when eaten alone.", "visit_purpose": "Casual dining after a bike ride", "visit_purpose_reason": "The review states that the diner capped off a bike ride with a trip to Don Barriga, indicating a casual dining experience.", "quality_criteria": "The service was prompt without feeling overbearing, and the chips and salsa were ideal, but the Shrimp Sope was dry when eaten alone.", "visit_context": "The diner visited with a partner after a recent bike ride.", "visit_context_reason": "The review mentions 'my partner and I' and 'recent bike ride', indicating the diner visited with a companion after biking."}}, {"review_id": "eOtuLXz1xisEuA29mOakjw", "item_id": "ErcLBEFjqr4nGbF4ozrvgg", "user_id": "delwr96keVngo4XIM0EnHA", "rating": 5.0, "timestamp": "2021-03-17 00:56:23", "review_text": "Great food for decent prices!

The choice was between them and their sister spot NuNu. Cheu closes earlier (10?! What is this, Wisconsin?) and had better music going (hip hop vs NuNu's Rock) so we went with Cheu. The food and drink menu was straightforward/limited so I did the brisket noodles and my guest did the chicken bao buns. She loved her buns (I forgot to get a pic...) but my noodles were too tough, the beef broth was water in flavor and the brisket eventually got lost in the bowl of shoe-lace tasting noodles. The dish was labeled \"spicy\" and that must've been a prank. I added half the chili oil to the bowl to wake it up and eventually settled on simply fishing the brisket out of the bowl. Drinks weren't much better. She ordered the Gangsta's Paradise which is so popular, there were 3 more on deck at the bar. So popular that it's prebatched in a plastic jug, even. She complained that it tasted like sugar water; too sweet and not boozy enough. I didn't even want to taste that, lol. I settled on what I assumed was a German wine whose flavor would compliment my \"spicy\" dish. The wine also tasted watered down. Just stock a regular Sauv-Blanc, you all. If both the bartender and I (both industry professionals) can't pronounce it and it's not a memorable pour, why even stock it? Moving on from the bad, Cheu atmosphere was chill and fun. The music was great in the background and the staff was SUPER friendly.

This bar doesn't participate, which was why I chose it because I am too old for the Sips crowd. Also, I have walked past this place a few times and noted the cool chalkboard signs out front. I think this place originally made its way onto my radar for the happy hour specials including wings and dumplings and $2 High Life's. Note: High Life's are no longer part of the Happy Hour menu. Damb.\n\nWhen I first walked in, I headed to the bar and the host guy kind of stopped me. Not physically stopped me, but he gave me a judgmental eye so fierce it had me hesitating. Apparently the bar isn't so much a \"bar\" as it is a seat-by-the-kitchen, so it's not seat yourself. Like when you sit at the \"bar,\" you're watching the dudes make the food right there in front of you. There's no \"bartender\" to serve you. I can see where this might seem like a good idea, but mehhhh.\n\nAnyway, I was solo and there was like 3 other people in the entire restaurant (only 1 person at the \"bar\") and the host asked me when the rest of my party was going to arrive because they typically don't seat \"incomplete parties.\" What? I can drink while I wait for my one friend to arrive, bruh. Just let me sit in your empty restaurant, k? I don't take up much space.\n\nI sat and waited for my friend to arrive (within the 10-15 minutes I quoted, though, I did notice the host continuously side eye me). The waitress was kind at first - she brought me a beer sample because I don't like to commit to a whole beer before I know if I like it so it doesn't go to waste. No worries about that because the beer I received was in the tiniest beer glass I think is allowed by law or something. If it was a whole pint, I am honestly flabbergasted by the laws of physics allowing an entire pint of beer to fit in that child size root beer hard candy looking mug. When my friend arrived, she ordered the same beer I did. The waitress popped over shortly after we each had a drink to take our food order but we had been chatting and weren't ready yet. At this point, I noticed the waitress start to get annoyed with us. Listen, your restaurant is not full and I intend on eating so don't be mad at me! \n\nSide note, since the \"bar\" isn't a real bar with a bartender and since there is a kitchen behind the bar, the waitress kept popping up behind us.  Little odd. I get it, like she had no choice based on the architecture of the space, but it's weird to constantly be addressed from behind throughout a meal.\n\nWe each ordered from the happy hour menu: dumplings for each of us, I ordered wings, and she ordered ragoons. The food was delicious. The wings were seasoned perfectly (if you like a mild cilantro surprise, like I do) and were crispy. Definitely K[orean]FC vibe. The dumplings were flavorful. I expected to be left a little hungry and was planning to order a second round of food afterward but the two happy hour apps really filled me up. The food was a pleasant surprise given the odd service experience up to that point.\n\nHonestly, I am conflicted. The service/vibe here was weird. But the food seems so promising based on the happy hour experience. Prices are reasonable (and would be moreso with a larger pour of beer). I'd like to come back and try more of the menu or even just get those wings again but the host/waitress kind of turned me off and I don't know if I will be back.  I wanted to really like you, Cheu.

Not full of gristle. Their blend of ingredients was very pleasing. I wouldn't go as far as to call it \"fusion\", but it was certainly a nice twist on an old favorite which needs to be tried to be appreciated.\n\nThe beef enchiladas were served with a red salsa. To my surprise the beef inside wasn't cheap ground beef, but instead was what I can only describe as a slow-roasted pulled beef. It had a great texture and a fantastic flavor. Not a mushy, greasy mess. The red salsa had a nice mild taste. A spicy green is also available upon request. \n\nThe rice and beans was also unique. It was seasoned black beans served atop a bed of a long grain rice. The rice itself seemed a little bland to me, but the spicy kick of the beans more than made up for it. I enjoyed it, but they definitely need to be eaten together. If you dislike beans and just want rice, you may be a little disappointed. To be fair, I did not try the rice alone before trying it with the beans, so the blandness I experienced may be partially due to the fact that I was expecting more. \n\nI believe Don Panchito's is off to a good start and will hopefully draw enough customers to continue to improve.

Additionally, they needed about one extra tortilla with the meat. As for the fajita meat quality, it was OK. I've definitely had better quality fajitas, and the meat tasted like something I could make at home.

I saw this place in the area and wanted to check it out since me and my wife like trying all the different Mexican places in the city. We go here Sunday 5pm and the place is empty, yes zero customers. Hmmm weird. The hostess/waiter was a nice guy but my guess is he was a friend or family member to the owner just helping out. Interior was ok nothing special. The table was super wobbly, no napkins, and no condiments. He brings us chips with queso that looked straight from the supermarket. Thought it was weird because why queso and not salsa. Asked for guacamole which he said no problem, we ordered out food, the food comes out. He then tells us no guacamole because the avocados they have aren't ripe so he's working on it, which probably means someone is running to Giant to get some ripe ones or the pre-made garbage. My wife got the chicken tacos which looked like they were put through a blender and put in a tortilla and my shrimp and steak fajitas didn't look bad but for $20, there should be more than 5 small sized shrimp. So for us being the only customers in the restaurant it took about an hour to get our food to the table. To the owner, I understand you have a Halal Mexican Restaurant in it's early stages. But if you expect to be successful you need to understand better how the Mexicans do food. It's typically salsa with chips, fresh guacamole, loud Mexican music (I swear I heard Arabic), more than one employee on a Sunday at dinner time, napkins on all tables, and the food is always plentiful and inexpensive. Go to some places in the city and see how they do things authentically. I will never go here again but just like me, others will be fooled when they see the massive amounts of 5 star reviews. I should have know better after seeing the names and those reviewers. I hope the owner listens to what I said in this review and can truly make this restaurant successful.

I ordered the barbacoa tacos, loaded fries, fried oreos, and a Mexican soda. The tacos were okay, they had a slightly better taste than Margaritas' steak tacos but this didn't include a lot of meat. When they arrived, it looked like something I would get from Taco Bell. They were a little bit spicy but it just burned the back of my throat. The fries are shoe string cut and apparently loaded meant cheese and some veggies, no meat. The nacho cheese they applied was very spicy and I had to stop eating it because my lips were on fire. Plus, it wasn't terribly flavorful. It was just bland and spicy with a little fries and a ton of spicy cheese. The fried oreos were ordinary. I love Jarritos and that was the best part of the meal. I would have given this place three stars but I feel that if they're going to charge two to three times what its competitor offers, that should at least mean either the quantity or quality was that much better and this was not the case.

Stein's Famous Deli has been in business for over 50 years. Not to age myself, I've been a customer for over 40! Why? When anyone has been a customer of any business for at least several years, and they haven't stayed because they're complacent or there aren't options that are much better (think about Cable or Mobile Phone Companies), the business must be doing something to make that customer loyal. If a business is so good, that customers want to recommend it to others, the company has created a \"brand advocate\". How does a business succeed for generations? They create, maintain, and build upon their \"brand equity\".\n\nMany people in life are myopic. In the business world, at almost every company, they cut corners, and/or they aren't consistent, and/or they don't know how to problem-solve effectively, and/or their customer service is a nightmare experience. In business school, when you have to study economics, you often find out that you can succeed by charging a lot of customers prices with lower profit margins l, or charging fewer customers higher prices Stein's has chosen the reason price route to success. I'm going to spare you the Yiddish, because regardless of where you come from, what gender you identify with, if you practice a religion, or what race you are- there's one thing people can enjoy blindly or with little to no hearing- that's FOOD.  When it comes to the deli business, Steven Stein has his Doctorate, PHD, and more. Why? Because you consistently get fresh and delicious deli at prices that are the most reasonable WITHOUT SACRIFICING QUALITY. \n\nStein is a class act. The reason: I've probably said to him 20 times, \"Steve, I've eaten at most of the best deli's in the United States. I can honestly tell you that from Delaware to South Jersey to at least Northeastern Pennsylvania, there's NOT a deli around that gives their customers fantastic quality, overall, at reasonable prices like you get at your deli.\" Every time, his response is something to the tone of, \"I have nothing bad to say about any of my competitors, They're all great.\"\n\nTo be objective, ALL DELIS ARE NOT GREAT. Steve Stein's Famous Deli is EXCELLENT. Steve and his son, Lee, run a fine tuned business. They don't sacrifice quality at the expense of affordable mouth-watering fresh deli. Many delis import smoked fish from the same company. Yet, the discrepancy in price can be upwards of 50% extra. Where can you go and, usually, buy FRESHLY SLICED Lox (Nova, Nova Belly, Regular) or Moist Fresh Kippered Salmon at UNDER $20 A POUND?

Still, far from a pleasant prospect, and one I hoped wouldn't be necessary for long. \n\nThe facility is a classic Kosher style Jewish deli/restaurant, with 75% dedicated to smoked meat, fish, and a large variety of salads, knishes, bakery and many premade meals. There was also a large green grocery with beautiful veggies stacked high. \n\nI ordered the Fried Matzo with extra Sautéed Onions mixed in. It arrived at my table the size of a large dinner plate. While not as crisp as my mother cooked in smaller patties, it was hot, steaming and delicious. A good shake of black pepper upped the spice level to where I liked it, along with the enhanced onion flavor requested at a $.50 up charge. I would certainly get that again. \n\nI also brought home a few Onion Bagels (semi-dense and excellent when toasted), and a couple of Potato Knishes for later consumption. They were traditional and very similar to my childhood memories - light wrap that baked well and held their contents to the end. Loved them. \n\nNot sure how often I'll go out to eat with these Covid regulations in place. They make the risk of exposure impossible to ignore. \n\nWe are, indeed, living in difficult and memorable times.\n\nPS. The complimentary slice of Apple Cake was very good and greatly appreciated.", "extracted_aspects": {"cuisine_category": "Jewish", "cuisine_category_reason": "The facility is described as a classic Kosher style Jewish deli/restaurant, indicating a preference for Jewish cuisine.", "specific_dishes_or_attributes": "The Fried Matzo was hot, steaming, and delicious, but not as crisp as the diner's mother's version.", "visit_purpose": "Breakfast", "visit_purpose_reason": "The diner visited for breakfast, as indicated by the mention of having breakfast in the dining room.", "quality_criteria": "The Fried Matzo was delicious but not as crisp as expected, while the Onion Bagels and Potato Knishes were traditional and very similar to childhood memories, which the diner loved.", "visit_context": "The diner visited the restaurant and interacted with Steve Stein, while complying with ID and vaccination card requirements.", "visit_context_reason": "The diner mentions the experience of being greeted by Steve Stein and the requirement of showing ID and vaccination card before entering, indicating a specific visit context."}}], "aspect_count": 16}

This area has a much smaller menu, but still so much to choose from. We ordered a little bit of everything between the chicken tacos, tuna tartar lettuce wraps, shrimp satays, salmon crispy sushi, 3 different pizzas, and the cookie plate and strawberry sundae for dessert.\n\nI loved everything especially the shrimp satays (we kept ordering more!) and tuna tartar. The tuna tartar was pretty spicy so I feel like that should be noted. The pizzas were all delicious but next time I would probably skip the Margherita as it was a bit too thin and wet. The truffle fontina was a last minute decision and one of my favorite things I've ever eaten. I would return just for that.\n\nThe only \"complaints\" I have is that we saw other tables with bread and olive oil and I didn't catch that on the menu so we think our server may have forgot to give us that. Also, I love dessert especially cookies so the cookie plate immediately caught our eye. The server happily explained that it was a variety of 5 cookies and we asked her if they come out warm and she said yes. When they came we immediately dug into the chocolate chip to find out it wasn't warm and the server said she forgot to tell us that only one of the 5 cookies is warm.

You can't really get a view quite this good from anywhere else in the city so it is not to be missed. On top of the killer views, the space itself is absolutely gorgeous although I do wish they had made the bar at both JG sky high and Jean Georges larger- the spectacular views make both places a must-see destination so I wish they had prepared for that. Nevertheless... our experiences at Jean Georges was everything we were expecting and more; I was seriously impressed. We were expecting the excellent service we have received at all the Four Seasons we have been to and Jean Georges was no exception, but our expectations were exceed by just how divine our meal was. My husband made us a reservation for our anniversary and we were seated in, what I believe to be, the best seat in the house- overlooking the south (views of both rivers!) in a cozy booth/couch for two. Our server, Mary, was phenomenal throughout the meal, helping us make some tough decisions and she did not steer us wrong once. \n\nWe debated getting the tasting menu but ultimately decided we would rather share everything and try more than we would get in the tasting menu. Here is what we chose:\n1. Although I have tried it a few times I am not at all familiar with caviar, however, knowing that Jean Georges is somewhat known for their 'indulgent' caviar dishes we decided to try one. Mary steered us towards the egg with vodka whipped cream which ended up being my most favorite thing we tried the whole night. The egg was creamy, the vodka whipped cream was light and the caviar lent the perfect saltiness to the dish- it felt like eating luxury if that were possible. It was simply spectacular. \n2. We actually ended up ordering two caviar dishes from the 'indulge' section because we were a little up in the air between two. Our second selection was the egg toast which was equally as luxurious tasting but the egg with the vodka whipped cream still has my heart.\n3. Then we ordered some items from the raw section, the first being the tuna noodles. When I tell you tuna is one of my favorite foods and I order it almost every time it's one a menu, I am not lying or exaggerating- You can look at my previous reviews. This tuna dish was, hands down, one of the best tuna dishes I've ever had, probably in my top 3. No further explanation needed.\n4. We also tried the uni which, although good, was my least favorite dish of the night. The uni was very obviously good, I just felt like the other dishes we tried were better.\n5. Next we tried the crab risotto. creamy, craby, a little crunchy, not too salty, not bland at all... it was delicious. there were definitely more aspects to this dish that I am not touching on that make it so good but, in my opinion, this is another must-try.\n6. We also tried the honeynut agnolotti which was.... amazing. the flavor combination was something I have never really experienced before, the closest thing I can think of is pasta in a brown butter sauce but WOW. Now, hear me out, if you are not a sweet/savory combo person, this dish may not be for you. My husband said it was good but it was hardly his favorite while I, on the other hand, could not stop eating it!! If you are a sweet/salty lover, this is a must-try.\n7. My husband got the duck for his entree which I just had a small bite of. It was tender and juice, not too greasy and, overall, delicious however....\n8. I thought my entree was better. I literally NEVER order chicken in a restaurant because, besides not really loving chicken, it is usually SO boring and there are usually much better options. However, this chicken caught my eye from the start... parmesan crusted, artichokes, lemon-basil sauce and wow, it was phenomenal. I wish I knew the secret to getting my chicken that evenly cooked and tender. plus the sauce was divine (yes, definitely lots of butter) and the artichokes were the perfect pairing that gave just a little tang. \n9. we ended up being too full for dessert but we were given a tower of petit fours to snack on. of course, all of them were delicious, but we especially liked the caramel, the hazelnut one, and my husband's favorite was the vanilla cluster. It was such a nice touch to the end of a fantastic meal.\n\nOverall, we had a fantastic dinner here and my husband and I both commented that it was one of the best we've had in recent history. Yes, you will pay a pretty penny for dinner but it is absolutely worth it (although I think drinks are overpriced but that's everywhere) for the quality of food, view and experience. FYI, we ended up getting 2 caviars, 2 raw dishes, 2 starches and 2 entrees and spent less money, including drinks, than we would have on the tasting menu so, if you want to try everything like me, I suggest ordering a la carte.

It is up so high that I got slightly dizzy looking out the window. If you have vertigo, you cannot look out the window as you go up in the elevator. The restaurant -- on both the 59th and 60th floors -- is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful we have ever seen. The banquettes are plush and spaced far away from each other, so you cannot hear one word of conversation from other tables -- a major plus. The 40-foot-high ceilings are otherworldly. A server named Patrick was extremely solicitous, and he came back numerous times to check on us (and solicit more drinks). Several dishes were out of this world, such as the salmon, sea bass, crab risotto and bread and amazing butter. Portions are small, though, for the prices, which are almost as high as the ceilings. The one dish that was really, really small was the mushroom and avocado carpaccio appetizer for $17. A bourbon/cherry/yuzu cocktail was fabulous, but the wines are outrageously priced, $15 to $20 for very small portions of wines which almost certainly cost less than $15 to $20 for an entire bottle at a wine store. I would go so far as to say that the wines, which just fill the very bottom of the glass, are a rip-off. You have no choice but to keep ordering them because there is so little wine in each glass.

While I had been to The Prime Rib when it was located in Center City, a number of years ago, I had yet to try \"the new one\" at Live! Casino and Hotel. I tried a number of times to make a last-minute reservation and was unsuccessful each time!  I was talking to my friend and we decided to make reservations for a Wednesday night. We chose Wednesday night because my friend did some research and she discovered that on Wednesday, they have a \"Happy Hour Special\" that they call, \"Bubbles and Peals!\" from 4:30pm - 6:30pm. Enjoy $1 oysters and $10 champagne flights with new pairings each week! The $1 oysters this week were from Prince Edward Island. (One of my favorites!) And the champagne flights consisted of 3 flutes #1, Prosecco, from Italy, #2, was a Rose' Champagne from France, and #3 was a Sparkling Wine from Spain. We shared 1 1/2 Dozen Oysters. and we had two fights of Champagne each! (One flight at a time!) We both ordered The Prime Rib Full Cut, cooked Medium... When I order Steak, I usually order it Medium Rare, but when I order Prime Rib, I order it Medium. Prime Rib, to me, always seems rarer than the description... We shared two sides, Creamed Spinach and 5 Cheese Truffle Mac N' Cheese! The Oysters were served on ice, with Lemon, Cocktail Sauce and Mignonette Sauce. (A vinegar and Shallot Sauce.) They were delicious! We both agreed the Cocktail Sauce was the better of the two sauces...  Before The Prime rib was served, I asked our server Adam to recommend a glass of wine to accompany my Rib. Chateau Bellegrave Medoc Bordeaux, France was his choice. It was WONDERFUL! My friend was content with her Bubbles! The Prime Rib was cooked to perfection! It was pink in the middle and nicely charred on the outside! It was a generous portion of meat! The sides were served with the Rib and were easily large enough for the two of us to share! The Prime Rib was served with a gravy boat of Au Juice that had such a nice flavor, I needed more! My friend didn't want it, so I was only too happy to commandeer hers! The Rib was easy to cut and as tender as it was tasty, and the outside charr was a nice addition to the already flavorful meat! The Fresh Creamed Spinach was as crispy as it was creamy! It was delicious! Then the 5 Cheese Truffle Mac N' Cheese! I never had anything like this! I'm not sure which 5 cheeses were used, but they were used well, and The Truffle Oil was perfectly proportioned and complimented all the cheeses. It was topped with a toasted cheese wafer that was delightful! It was a wonderful meal and we were both stuffed! I had a happy plate, but my friend had to take some of hers home with her! Desert was NOT considered... On the way out we decided to play some slots I put up $20 and left with $50, and my friend made $20!

I should preface this review by saying the last time my family did Thanksgiving in a restaurant was in 1992. This year due to similar circumstances we chose to try it again and it was the most delicious Thanksgiving I've ever experienced! Way better than my family's cooking and we didn't have to clean-up! There were just six of us this year. We arrived a little before noon and started with some mixed drinks at the hotel bar next door to the restaurant. Then we walked next door to the restaurant a few minutes after they opened the doors. The first thing we saw were the desserts  which were delicious but not the highlight of the day. The highlight in my opinion is a tie between the turkey and the seafood/raw bar. Both were outstanding come to think of it, EVERYTHING was outstanding ! I loved the gravy, turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed sweet and white potatoes, two kinds of stuffing, the cheese bar, the bread bar I mean there was so much to try and everything was top notch quality! From a culinary perspective it was so much better than any other Thanksgiving meal I've ever experienced and way better than my own cooking and I'm considered a pretty good cook! \n\nThere were tons of things I didn't try including the salmon, prime rib and the short ribs. I also didn't try the many salad options but I  did try some of the various fruit options just to accompany the cheese which was fantastic. I loved the Brie but didn't bother with the crab corn chowder or the charcuterie because I'm all about the classics. The only thing missing was the green bean and mushroom casserole which is one of my favorite thanksgiving dishes (I make it from scratch) however my cousin's Brussels sprouts (no lie they tasted almost exactly the same) were in attendance - not my fave but clearly I'm in the minority. My health conscious brother even indulged in the good stuff not just the healthy options. And my whole family spent a few hours in food bliss. Mine was immediately followed by regret because I ate way too much - probably three times what I could reasonably handle. It was so good that even the post meal discomfort  wouldn't deter me from going again next year.

I loved the grilled vegetables - I'd the asparagus and grilled onions. Sister dear loved the Brussels sprouts.we both loved the caramel apple pie with streusel topping and pumpkin torte. We also enjoyed the little caramel chocolate mousse \"shots\" and en the real Champagne was a nice touch. Staff were friendly and extremely busy. My sister said the fruit was sweet. I didn't want to overdo it like last time. So I only went to the buffet once and didn't look back at what I missed. There were a variety of cheeses, salads and fruit accompaniments.

No need to go back to cooking not as long as Chez C continues to serve Thanksgiving buffet oh and nothing was over salted and I wasn't thirsty afterwards so there was nothing added that shouldn't have been there - get my drift?

This place is runned by two guys - Eddy and Tony. Went on a Sunday night twice first time on five pm and second time at eight pm prior to catching a bus back to New York. In total we got about six beef and lamb skewers, two chicken wings, four chicken gizzard skewers, four squids. Total price was about $20 + $40 dollars. You got two incredible bros grilling in front of your eyes making some delicious meats. What more can you ask for for a perfect night?\n\nAMBIANCE:\nThis is what I love about restaurants like TT. It's small shop with probably enough seating for six, it's crowded, and it's a quintessential hole in the wall. But IMO underneath this nondescript presentation there is an aroma of incredible spices and meats. You have to be there to check it out!\n\nPROS:\nAll the skewers we got!! The beef and lamb were INCREDIBLE. The spice rub is a blend of cayenne, red peppers, salt, pepper, and a generous dose of cumin. Eddy was telling us how he specifically adds a bit of fat on the skewers to make them extra juicy. Boy was he right! We had ours at mild and it gave us quite a kick, but you can tell the meat was incredibly fresh! \n\nThe marinade that they used for the squid and the chicken wings were also apparent as we can taste a slight acidity and sweetness on top of the rub that they used. My friend raved about how good the gizzard was and knowing that he's a foodie as well I trust his judgment too! \n\nEddy and Tony were incredibly friendly. They were telling us how their business started and how much blood sweat and tears they poured into it. I can tell - their skewers are definitely labors of love and you can tell there is so much of their personalities in it. We had a good chat on the whole cooKing and marinating process that they do to prep their meats. Might come back to Philly just to take a lesson from them on how they prepare their food!\n\nOVERALL:\nTT skewers are the type of business that I hands down will support in any capacity of mine.
