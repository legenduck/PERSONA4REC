The former pro rugby player had just been signed to play under his dream coach for the Sydney Smoke when a car accident changed his whole plan. Now he’s travelled to the other side of the world with no plans other than to rest and recuperate in his friend’s empty home. Only the home isn’t empty. Jane Spencer is a single mother and professional restorer tasked with a project that will put her company on the map. It’s bad enough her ex bailed on his time with their son, now she has to juggle an active four-year-old and a rogue chameleon with intricate, time-consuming work. The last thing she needs is a too-sexy-for-words rugby star distracting her. Except rather than lounge around, Cole offers to help her with daycare. And if watching him with her son isn’t enough to melt her heart, when she and Cole are alone in the evenings other things begin to melt. Jane can’t begin to calculate the number of complications falling for Cole would bring, but sometimes lust and love can’t be denied…<br /><br />I don’t know how she did it, but in Playing with Trouble Amy Andrews delivered a book that’s both totally adorable and seriously sexy. Cole has physically been through a lot and mentally is still struggling to imagine a life without playing rugby. All he wants to do at the beginning of this book is brood, but Jane and her son, Finn, throw his plans right out the window. The kid wraps Cole around his finger almost immediately and how could you not be charmed by the vibrant little boy (or his escape artist pet chameleon)? Cole and Finn’s bond will absolutely melt your heart. Cole knows what it’s like not to have a father and he and Finn just click from the start. And Jane’s love for her son, her worries, and her absolute determination to make sure he knows he’s loved and cared for are equally heart-melting. Normally I’m a little “meh” on adorable children popping up a lot in romances but in Playing with Trouble it works and is important to the story.<br /><br />Sweet parts aside, let’s get to the sexy. Jane and Cole have sizzling chemistry that no amount of Jane telling herself she can’t give into temptation will deny. I enjoyed the simmering sexual tension, but when things boil over Playing with Trouble is spicy good fun. Living on opposite sides of the world isn’t the biggest obstacle they face, but I trusted Ms. Andrews to make it all work in the end. Every bump in the road is worth it as Jane and Cole come to know each other and I loved how they just fit as a solid unit.<br /><br />Playing with Trouble is a standalone novel but it is connected to both Ms. Andrews’s Sydney Smoke Rugby and her Credence, Colorado series. If you haven’t read either, it won’t hamper your story, though admittedly not having read the Credence, Colorado series I’m now eager to dive in because I liked the town and its residents so much. In Playing with Trouble Amy Andrews blends humor, heart, and heat perfectly to deliver an entertaining story that’s worth enjoying again and again.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

With traps at every turn, Luke must remain anonymous and go against his instincts to survive.<br /><br />Steeped in action, the subject matter and tone is dark and gritty with some cringeworthy moments. As the plot develops, it’s unknown who can be trusted and that adds to the tension. With vying interests at play, it becomes a race against time.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this book is how Luke battled with his natural instinct to protect. Plus, reading the friendship Luke shares with Tomas emphasizes how much of a bond they share. As for Vera, she managed to surprise everyone with her abilities. That said, I wanted a little more development between Vera and Luke and Vera and her sister. Regarding the secondary characters, all proved to be devious along with an interesting element.<br /><br />Unshackle is a dark romance set in an underworld of corruption and greed.
