One rainy morning in June, two years after the end of World War II, a minor traffic accident brings together Eleanor Moskowitz and Patricia Bellamy. Their encounter seems fated: Eleanor, a teacher and recent Vassar graduate, needs a job. Patricia’s difficult thirteen-year-old daughter Margaux, recovering from polio, needs a private tutor. Though she feels out of place in the Bellamys’ rarefied and elegant Park Avenue milieu, Eleanor forms an instant bond with Margaux. Soon the idealistic young woman is filling the bright young girl’s mind with Shakespeare and Latin. Though her mother, a hat maker with a little shop on Second Avenue, disapproves, Eleanor takes pride in her work, even if she must use the name \"Moss\" to enter the Bellamys’ restricted doorman building each morning, and feels that Patricia’s husband, Wynn, may have a problem with her being Jewish. Invited to keep Margaux company at the Bellamys’ country home in a small town in Connecticut, Eleanor meets Patricia’s unreliable, bohemian brother, Tom, recently returned from Europe. The spark between Eleanor and Tom is instant and intense. Flushed with new romance and increasingly attached to her young pupil, Eleanor begins to feel more comfortable with Patricia and much of the world she inhabits. As the summer wears on, the two women’s friendship grows—until one hot summer evening, a line is crossed, and both Eleanor and Patricia will have to make important decisions—choices that will reverberate through their lives. Gripping and vividly told, Not Our Kind illuminates the lives of two women on the cusp of change—and asks how much our pasts can and should define our futures.", "item_summary": "Not Our Kind is a post-World War II novel set in New York City, focusing on the unlikely friendship between Eleanor Moskowitz, a Jewish teacher, and Patricia Bellamy, a WASP from Park Avenue.

Massive crowds surge forward, awaiting their glimpse of heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt. Just 18, the beautiful bride has not only arrived late, but in tears, yet her marriage to the aloof Duke of Marlborough proceeds. Bullied into the wedding by her indomitable mother, Alva, Consuelo loves another.

At Blenheim Palace, Consuelo is confronted with an overwhelming list of duties, including producing an “heir and a spare,” but her relationship with the duke quickly disintegrates. Consuelo finds an inner strength, charming everyone from debutantes to diplomats including Winston Churchill, as she fights for women’s suffrage.

I don’t wear cosmetics, do my hair or really give a damn about my appearance in general.

Kicking off senior year, my only focus is to make every AP class count and keep my grades up. Shouldn’t be hard, particularly with my so-called untouchable status. Oh yeah, imagine that—I had a reputation. Hadn’t been a blip on my radar until the end of junior year when one of the girls’ dropped that little nugget on me. Apparently, the guys at school considered me the best girl to hang out with for fun or homework, but nothing else. While I’m not looking for a date, it’s a little hard to swallow that I ranked as the best bud and tutor, but would definitely never fall into the Girl Most Likely To Get Asked Out.Pfft. What did I care? One more year and I was off to college, so what if the numbers of female friends I used to have drifted off and I’d scored a permanent seat in the friend zone. I had subjects to study, grades to maintain, and colleges to get into. Fine, I didn’t care about the rules or status before, and I wouldn’t now. 181 class days to go, and I’ll graduate.

A perfect palate cleanser to my always reading PNR RHs. This fit really well with the mood I was in. Frankie is a decent person I don’t find her annoying even though she’s a teenager. I do find her mother’s behavior and treatment of her to be dismal, sad and annoying. But once we find out more about her mother…well I’m shocked tbh. But that’s only a minor part of the story.<br /><br />The major point of the story, but isn’t really told too clearly is that basically the guys told the school through their actions that Frankie was “untouchable” or off limits, but their excuse was “because she didn’t date”. Which honestly is kind of silly. They took it upon themselves to vett potential people who wanted to date her, and basically rejected them all, but didn’t get her input not once. But no oh oh they were allowed to date, they were allow to kiss and more, but she wasn’t. I still am not quite sure why she wanted to be friends with them aside from a long standing history and wanting to keep their friendship together.<br /><br />Despite this, the story is still filled with cute and funny moments. But overall I think the book could use a ton of tidying up.<br /><br />There are many extra random “a” and “I” on the page. Lots of missing words, wrong words, or the usage of eel in the way it is was confusing. Idk if the author is from the states, I forgot to check, but IMO if you’re going to have a character living in the states then knowing a majority of the writing and vernacular would be helpful. When I first saw the word “eeling” I was completely confused, then I highlighted it to look it up and no such word was there. So I was further perplexed what was meant, until the usage of “eel out of their grip” made it make sense. But for a majority I was completely confused. It was an odd word choice.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy the book but was disappointed “Mr. Thorns” wasn’t addressed bc Frankie saw what she saw and dipped super quickly. So the book ended before that was even resolved.<br /><br />The book is also super slow and mundane, bc I totally expected Mr. Thorns to either A. Try to harm her, or B. Do something creepy.

I came upon the Untouchable series via TikTok (BookTok). I usually don’t read books that have been recommended there, but I took a chance with Heather Long’s first book in the Untouchable series. The synopsis of the first book, Rules & Roses, caught my eye, and I immediately dived into not second-guessing myself. It had what I was looking for when I looked for different recommendations for Reverse Harem. I’m not new to Reverse Harem. I’ve read the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series by LKH. (Heather Long’s Untouchable series is much tamer than that series.)<br /><br />Storyline/My Thoughts: Now, let me first say, the characters in this book are based in high school. They are all Seniors. One of them is already eighteen, and the others are still seventeen. Some readers may not feel comfortable with some of the scenes mentioned in this book. If you don’t like reading about teenagers making out and more, and doing other explicit things, this series may not be for you. That includes underage drinking at parties, too.<br />I know teenagers do things they shouldn’t. (Ummm…I was a teenager at one time, but I’m not even going to say what I did. My mother or my own teenage daughter may come across this review.) I am moving on to what I thought about the book before incriminating myself.<br /><br />Frankie, the main female protagonist (telling the story), has four guys as best friends. She’s always been one of the guys, and they have always treated her like one. Her best friends have dated throughout high school, but she has never dated. She finds out from a girl named Rachel that the guys have made it known that Frankie is not to be touched. She doesn’t like when she finds out this information, and for the summer after Junior year, she decides to keep herself busy and away from her friends she’s known so long instead of confronting them. Frankie decides she will focus on her future and get through high school. Her French TA asks her out one day, and she accepts. She wants to start experiencing high school as her friends have been. The guys find out the truth and confront her, and now they will do anything to prove to her they want to date her. Her guy friends, Coop, Bubba (aka Ian), Jake, and Archie, dump their girlfriends before school starts and make it known they want to give Frankie all the dating experiences. They don’t care if she dates every one of them.<br />Each one has a different personality.<br />Since elementary school, Coop has been her closest friend and lives near her. He’s there for her always.<br />Bubba (aka Ian) is a football player plus a musician who is the first to ask her out to Homecoming. He’s such a sweetie and lets her decide what she wants and doesn’t pressure her into anything.<br />Jake is another football player and is very protective of her. He’s the first one to call her out on her distance. He’s also a hothead and will snap at anyone who tries to hurt Frankie.<br />Archie is the rich one who wants to worship the ground she walks on because he will do anything for her. He’s also the one that makes it known how much he wants her physically.<br />I loved getting to know all the characters in the first book in the Untouchable series. I liked Frankie’s character because she’s a determined high schooler who has goals and wants to achieve them, even if she’s overworking herself. Sometimes being overworked can put a damper on relationships and experiencing life, and I felt for her.<br /><br />Now, there’s bound to be drama since Frankie decides to date every one of them. Firstly, past ex-girlfriends and a mother who is never there for Frankie. Don’t even get me started with Frankie’s mother. I was not too fond of her character because she was only mentioned a few times.I also liked that the chapters included text message conversations with the boys. I got to see what they thought about everything, and I hope there are more of those types of chapters in the next book(s).<br /><br />Here’s the issue with the book I had and why I gave it only three stars. There was so much mention about AP classes, school work, and eating that I skipped over words/pages in the book. I wanted the interaction of Frankie and her friends, but not their every movement and the constant repetition of specific conversations they already had in the book. It drove me bonkers at times, but I had to remind myself it was high school. Minus those issues, the book was okay. I find myself invested in continuing to reading the series, especially after the cliffhanger at the end. I wasn’t expecting it.<br /><br />This book does have some steam to it, so again, if you are not comfortable with steamy scenes in a young adult book, then this book may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Standalone or Part of Series: It’s part of the Untouchable series by Heather Long, and I would recommend reading order.<br /><br />Cliffhanger: Yes.<br /><br />Trope(s)/Element(s): Reverse Harem; Friends to Lovers<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? Yes.

The former pro rugby player had just been signed to play under his dream coach for the Sydney Smoke when a car accident changed his whole plan. Now he’s travelled to the other side of the world with no plans other than to rest and recuperate in his friend’s empty home. Only the home isn’t empty. Jane Spencer is a single mother and professional restorer tasked with a project that will put her company on the map. It’s bad enough her ex bailed on his time with their son, now she has to juggle an active four-year-old and a rogue chameleon with intricate, time-consuming work. The last thing she needs is a too-sexy-for-words rugby star distracting her. Except rather than lounge around, Cole offers to help her with daycare. And if watching him with her son isn’t enough to melt her heart, when she and Cole are alone in the evenings other things begin to melt. Jane can’t begin to calculate the number of complications falling for Cole would bring, but sometimes lust and love can’t be denied…<br /><br />I don’t know how she did it, but in Playing with Trouble Amy Andrews delivered a book that’s both totally adorable and seriously sexy. Cole has physically been through a lot and mentally is still struggling to imagine a life without playing rugby. All he wants to do at the beginning of this book is brood, but Jane and her son, Finn, throw his plans right out the window. The kid wraps Cole around his finger almost immediately and how could you not be charmed by the vibrant little boy (or his escape artist pet chameleon)? Cole and Finn’s bond will absolutely melt your heart. Cole knows what it’s like not to have a father and he and Finn just click from the start. And Jane’s love for her son, her worries, and her absolute determination to make sure he knows he’s loved and cared for are equally heart-melting. Normally I’m a little “meh” on adorable children popping up a lot in romances but in Playing with Trouble it works and is important to the story.<br /><br />Sweet parts aside, let’s get to the sexy. Jane and Cole have sizzling chemistry that no amount of Jane telling herself she can’t give into temptation will deny. I enjoyed the simmering sexual tension, but when things boil over Playing with Trouble is spicy good fun. Living on opposite sides of the world isn’t the biggest obstacle they face, but I trusted Ms. Andrews to make it all work in the end. Every bump in the road is worth it as Jane and Cole come to know each other and I loved how they just fit as a solid unit.<br /><br />Playing with Trouble is a standalone novel but it is connected to both Ms. Andrews’s Sydney Smoke Rugby and her Credence, Colorado series. If you haven’t read either, it won’t hamper your story, though admittedly not having read the Credence, Colorado series I’m now eager to dive in because I liked the town and its residents so much. In Playing with Trouble Amy Andrews blends humor, heart, and heat perfectly to deliver an entertaining story that’s worth enjoying again and again.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

In fact, it may have gone a bit too slow at first, and that's coming from a reader whose favorite trope is slow burn! In the first half of the book, Cole spent more time with Jane's son Finn than with Jane herself, and while Cole and Jane had a few decent conversations and shared a couple of passionate kisses in that time, it didn't feel like quite enough of a basis for their relationship. Fortunately, things improved substantially about halfway through the book. Cole and Jane finally started to grow closer and I felt the chemistry between them more and more. Despite the obvious challenges they faced, I really liked them together and wanted things to work out for them.<br /><br />Cole was an incredibly likeable and sympathetic lead character. I felt so bad for what he was going through because of his injury and having to come to terms with the end of his professional rugby career. Fortunately, he seemed to be handling it well, and the time he spent with Jane and Finn seemed to be therapeutic in a lot of ways. Cole turned out to be really good with kids, and I loved the scenes of him interacting with the 4- and 5-year-olds during his rugby clinic. His nicknames for them were hilarious, as was his spot-on observation that working with kids at that age is like trying to herd cats.<br /><br />There were a number of wonderful secondary characters included in this story, many of whom I recognized from earlier books in the Credence, Colorado series. I especially enjoyed the time Cole spent at the Lumberjack bar with Arlo, Tucker, and Drew. I'm still hoping that Arlo and Drew will get stories of their own in the future!<br /><br />Despite the slow start to Jane and Cole's romance, I loved this funny, sweet, and heartwarming story and highly recommend it for fans of contemporary romance and romantic comedy.

The virus is a fast acting version of rabies infecting people and animals in the New England states.  It is spreading rapidly and quarantines are being strictly enforced.  At the center is a very pregnant woman and her best friend from college.<br /><br />The book fails a bit on the execution.  This is the 2nd book I have read by Tremblay and I can say this for him, he seems to be able to redeem himself in the conclusion of his stories.  Both SURVIVOR SONG and HEAD FULL OF GHOSTS had surprising (and surprisingly good) endings, after chapters full of tedious repetitions, that did nothing to further the plot.  I rarely skim when I read, but SURVIVOR SONG had me doing just that, when scene after scene of Zombie-like attacks went on and on.<br /><br />The problem I see, is there is very little building of tension.  The dramatic scenes would be much more impactful if there was some kind of build up to, and a break in between.  Instead, the entire book is mostly full-blown tense action scenes, with no chance to catch your breath in between.  I am not sure if I will be reading more books by this author or not.

I love books about viruses or medical disasters and so this was a plus for me. To me a good horror book brings out the unexplained or the mystery of what is happening or what is going to happen and that is what Survivor Song details.<br /><br />It's rich with devastation and a mystery all brought forth through a tale of struggle and survival against the horror unfolding. What I find intriguing is how now we are going through the covid pandemic as of this writing and it gives it a personal reality to the story. The fear and dread of the unknown aspects of a virus, today's atmosphere gives a relevant reality to Survivor Song.<br /><br />I am one that fears true horrors, horrors of a natural sense such as infection and viruses and the unknown of those infections. This book plays on the reality based horrors. This is a book mixed with deep rich brilliant moments with flawlessly written characters.<br /><br />This dark story of strength and unknown lessons becomes a wonderful spiraling complete journey of emotional choices, actions and personal beliefs and struggles.<br /><br />Tremblay created a vast world of thoughtful and disturbing characters. He created a landscape or formed a world in it's own little time line. Ramola and Natalie are what character building is all about. Those two characters are created deeply for the reader to bring the reader into that struggle on page after page of tension and survival.<br /><br />There is a part of all of us in these two characters. Also the two teenage boys, Josh and Luis, there friendship, brotherhood and ultimate sensitive love for one another in the end of their journey is honestly something that pulls at the heart strings of humanity.<br /><br />That is what makes this book work and the reality of the virus to me is not the main subject, the main subject is about life, it's about how life, or to live is the focus to move forward or to protect that ultimate means that all of us possess, the will and want to live.<br /><br />Solidly executed with a mastery in building a fairy tale of truth. A personal touch of the human heart and the human will. This book plays out in truths, choices, struggles but most of all the formation of forward by any means, forward with life no matter all the horrors, either human in nature or darkness prone. Ramola and Natalie or a part of us all.<br /><br />Would I Return to It Again: Absolutely, somewhere down the lane of time I will adventure along with Ramola and Natalie once again.<br /><br />Would I Recommend: Passionately.

Then : Sixteen-year-old Charlie Lewis is the kind of boy you don’t remember in the school photograph. He’s failing his classes. At home he looks after his depressed father—when surely it should be the other way round—and if he thinks about the future at all, it is with a kind of dread.   But when Fran Fisher bursts into his life and despite himself, Charlie begins to hope.   In order to spend time with Fran, Charlie must take on a challenge that could lose him the respect of his friends and require him to become a different person. He must join the Company. And if the Company sounds like a cult, the truth is even more appalling: The price of hope, it seems, is Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet learned and performed in a theater troupe over the course of a summer. Now : Charlie can’t go the altar without coming to terms with his relationship with Fran, his friends, and his former self.

She struggles to shine on her own beneath her futbol-star brother's shadow.

I don’t think I’ve ever read a book with one (that was classified as regular fiction anyway lol) and I knew I needed it once the reviews started coming in. And when I finally read it, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Clara has gone to her long time crush’s new residence and left all her problems with her mom (and all things that come with that) behind her. Just when she thinks she has a chance with him, he surprises her with: I rented out the room and I’m leaving instead. And lo and behold, the person he rented it out to is the exact opposite of quiet, bookworm, laminated rules Clara…. He’s an adult performer. As the summer goes on, they learn that they have more in common than they thought.<br /><br />Now with the narrators, I really enjoyed them. It’s no secret that Brittany Pressley is one of my favorites. I say it every time she narrates another book. And this one is no different. She further cemented my love for this book. And the fact that there is a dual narrator made it even better. Teddy Hamilton did a great job as Josh. This wasn’t your usual book, but Hamilton made it seem like it was.<br /><br />For the actual book, I LOVED the plot. I gave this almost a full rating because I thought the pacing was slightly off, but overall, it was a fun, very steamy book. And Idk, I love the opposites attract troupe; especially when there’s a nerd/bookworm involved. And as I said, this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />The romance was very cute. I felt like I went through all the emotions with them. I was extremely happy, I was sad, I was excited for them, I felt it all. The only thing I didn’t like about it was the pacing. It kept going from 0 to sixty and then 0 again for long periods of time back to 60. I would have much preferred them to do it gradually, like start with a kiss or something and then kept amping it up after that. I guess it all felt weird to me to see them still acting like something as big as a SPOILER handie END SPOILER didn’t happen. But otherwise, watching the two of them be together was super cute!<br /><br />This was so different than other things I’ve read, but I really enjoyed this.

She has always been prim and proper and done what her family has asked, but when her lifelong crush calls and asks her to move out to California with him she packs up and goes. Only one issue, she gets there and Everett, her crush, lets her know he is going on tour with his band. She will still be living at his place, but with Josh a guy Everett found on craigslist.

Not just any porn star, he has a different approach with women and wants them to have their needs met on and off the camera.<br /><br />Needless to say, this was a fun and such a unique rom-com. I loved Clara and how shy and innocent she was. When she finds out Josh is a porn star is actually hilarious and with Josh being so confident with his body and sex, it just made the atmosphere so funny and steamy. I obviously enjoyed the romance, but I loved the plot in this book as well. Clara is finally on her own and gets to decide what she actually wants to do with her life, and Josh is being underpaid and wants better than what he is getting.

Effie's story however provided the 9 circles of angst that made it unputdownable. Bullied lonely orphan who recently lost loved ones, newbie at the Order of Prophecy which is uber creepy due to the fantastic world building, secret orders, secret powers, secret realms with one way doors, looming wars and zombie like like shadow creatures. I mean what s there not to like right ? to tell you the truth, it took me a minute to grasp it all and then Smoke made an entrance and I perked up in terror. Shane East's characterization of the Triamvarate is terrifying, holy smokes I ve never heard Shane sound so ominous. Absolutely fantastic performance. Stella's Effie is run down but not defeated which is may favorite kind of heroine. The fake it till you make it kind. She is sassy, unafraid and determined even if she is unsure of her horrific visions and how to interpret them nor how to deal with her tutor and her guardian who are already competing for her attention. Her sexual and emotional tension with Lucien and Kieran adds more layers of angst because you can tell the chemistry is so intense when it explodes its going to be epic ! the books ends on an expected cliffhanger and I am so excited for parts 2 and 3 because this fantastical world of dreamers, keepers and shadows has so much more to be revealed !", "extracted_aspects": {"category_preference_reason": "The reviewer mentions enjoying elements typical of fantasy genres, such as 'fantastic world building,' 'secret orders,' 'secret powers,' 'secret realms,' and 'looming wars.'

Stella Hunter as always can do no wrong.  She was magnificent as Effie and portrayed her character with style and grace.  I have been a fan of Shane East for a long time but we definitely get a different side to him in this story.  He does a fantastic portrayal of Lucian but for me what set him apart from anything else was his performances with the evil roles.  There were a few times that I got chills up my spine (and not in that normal and dreamy way Shane so often does).<br /><br />The first portion of this audiobook was The Dreamer (the prequel to The Keeper's Legacy) which focused mainly on Kieran and his quest to find his Effie from his visions.  He knew she was out there somewhere and was determined to find her and get the answer's he needs.  Then we get into The Keeper's Legacy which is mostly from Effie's POV.  Effie was an incredibly strong heroine who was dealing with visions of her own.  There is so much action and intensity within this story and I am not so patiently waiting for the next book in this trilogy.  This does end on a mild cliffhanger which can tide me over until the next book releases.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this audiobook.

They are vastly different men and yet she is drawn to them both.  Amidst those confusing feelings, she continues to have visions and nightmares that seem to be warnings for the future of Elysia.<br /><br />I loved the mystery, suspense and danger as well as the wonderful world building by Meg Anne.  I also loved how Effie grew bolder, stronger and more than certain that she would not be treated as less than she deserved.  Kieran and Lucian, along with other side characters, were colorful and interesting too.  Just as things between them seem likely to change, we are given a cliffhanger that left me more than anxious for the next story.  I cannot wait to see what lies ahead for them all!<br /><br />The audiobook is fantastic and brings these intriguing characters and this mysterious world to such vivid life!  Stella Hunter, Shane East and James Joseph are outstanding throughout.  Stella voices Effie to perfection and brings out both her vulnerability and her strength.
