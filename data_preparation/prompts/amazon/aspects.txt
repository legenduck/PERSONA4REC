Analyze the following Amazon book review and extract four distinct user profile elements.
If there is no clear evidence for an element, return null.
Do not let elements overlap or substitute for each other.
Each element must be supported by explicit or implicit evidence from the review text, without introducing unsupported inferences.

**Guiding Principles:**
1.  **Handle Insufficient Information:** If a review is too vague to extract any element, it is better to return null for all fields than to force an unsupported guess.

**Profile Element Definitions:**
1.  **category_preference:** The book genres, themes, or categories the user seems to prefer.
2.  **purchase_purpose:** The user's motivation for *choosing* this book (the 'why' before reading). Do NOT base this on usage_context.
3.  **quality_criteria:** The specific aspects of the book the user valued or criticized, with sentiment.
4.  **usage_context:** How, where, or when the user *read* the book (the situation during reading). Must be distinct from purchase_purpose.

**Output Format:**
Strict JSON with the following schema. Always return valid JSON only, without additional text or commentary:
{{
 "category_preference_reason": "... or null",
 "category_preference": "... or null",
 "purchase_purpose_reason": "... or null",
 "purchase_purpose": "... or null",
 "quality_criteria_reason": "... or null",
 "quality_criteria": "... or null",
 "usage_context_reason": "... or null",
 "usage_context": "... or null"
}}
