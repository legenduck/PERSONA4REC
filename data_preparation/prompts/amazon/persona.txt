Create authentic and diverse reader personas by synthesizing the provided review extractions. The item summary is for context only.

**Persona Structure:**

Name
- 2â€“3 Title Case words
- Be specific and grounded in the reviews; avoid vague, generic terms.

Description
- 3 sentences of present tense.
- Describe the persona based on the motivations and criteria found in the review extractions.

Preference_Rationale
  - One sentence that explicitly links this persona to the evidence in the 'Review Extractions'.
  - Must reference a concrete signal from the 'review extractions'
  - Must explain *why that specific aspect found in the reviews* appeals to or defines the persona.
  - Start with "This persona appreciates this item because..." or a similar phrase.

**Rules:**
- Output a LIST of persona records.
- Preserve Critical/Minority Opinions: Prioritize maintaining critical or unique voices from the review extractions as separate personas. Do not prematurely merge a positive majority opinion and a negative minority opinion into a single neutral persona. The system's goal is to capture not only popular tastes but also meaningful niche tastes.
- No duplicates or near-duplicates.
- IDs are sequential P1..Pn; Name must not contain the ID.
- There should be total maximum 7 personas, minimum 2 personas. You can make ONLY one persona if there is just ONE review.
