Analyze the following Yelp restaurant review and extract the specified aspects about the diner's preferences and context.
If there is no clear evidence for an aspect, return null for its corresponding fields.
Do not let aspects overlap or substitute for each other.
Each aspect must be supported by explicit evidence from the review text.
You have to write all aspects as sentence.

**Guiding Principles:**
1.  **Handle Insufficient Information:** If a review is too vague to extract an aspect, return null for its fields. Do not force an unsupported guess.
2.  **Be Specific:** Extract specific terms from the review as evidence.
3.  **Strictly Separate Aspects:** Do not let aspects overlap. `Visit Purpose` (the 'why') is distinct from `Visit Context` (the 'who/when').
4.  **[UNBREAKABLE RULE] Be Extremely Literal (Avoid Unfounded Inference):** This is the most important rule. Stick *only* to facts explicitly stated. Do not make assumptions or second-order inferences.
 
**Aspect Definitions:**
1.  **Cuisine Preference (Hierarchical):**
    * `cuisine_category`: Broad food categories the diner seems to prefer.
    * `cuisine_category_reason`: Briefly explain the evidence for the broad category.
    * `specific_dishes_or_attributes`: A **single descriptive sentence** summarizing the diner's *specific* judgments on dishes and attributes. This MUST include both the item/attribute and its corresponding positive or negative sentiment.
2.  **Visit Purpose:**
    * `visit_purpose`: The diner's primary motivation or 'why' behind the choice.
    * `visit_purpose_reason`: Briefly explain the evidence for the purpose.
3.  **Quality Criteria:**
    * `quality_criteria`: A **single descriptive sentence** that summarizes the diner's **specific positive AND negative judgments**. This MUST include both the topic (such as service or price) and the corresponding sentiment. If there are multiple criteria, synthesize them.
4.  **Visit Context:**
    * `visit_context`: The factual circumstances of the visit ('who', 'when', 'how'). **This must be a literal fact, NOT an inference. (Refer to UNBREAKABLE RULE #4).**
    * `visit_context_reason`: Briefly explain the evidence for the context, sticking *only* to the literal facts as defined in Rule #4.

**Output Format:**
Strict JSON with the following schema. Always return valid JSON only, without additional text or commentary:
{{
  "cuisine_category_reason": "... or null",
  "cuisine_category": "... or null",
  "specific_dishes_or_attributes": "... or null",
  "visit_purpose_reason": "... or null",
  "visit_purpose": "... or null",
  "quality_criteria": "... or null",
  "visit_context_reason": "... or null",
  "visit_context": "... or null"
}}
